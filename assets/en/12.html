Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. Cabinfever<br>

No if not a romantic relationship, then at least the feeling of love can cause serious mental discomfort for many Fish. In the passion of someone they find a way to escape from himself, to get rid of the accumulated problems and immerse yourself in the pleasant dreams and fantasies. In this case the initiative, a Fish exhibit extremely rare, and from a person who is likable, waiting for certain steps and courtesies, as if not knowing that he can Express interest in some other way.

Before the intentions of the "second party" extremely clear, however, and often thereafter), Fish anxious and worried, spending time thinking about whether they are worthy of love and able to love the one on whom their choice fell. Meanwhile, to make the relationship started in reality and not just in your fantasies, you don't need much to learn beyond the limits of its own, albeit a very rich inner world and to use the opportunities offered by life. Romantic charming reverie, but it is only one side of your nature; pay attention to other facets of nature, and you will see changessituation.

You can certainly find the person, whose decisions will make you happy. But do not forget that you can be happy spending time alone and achieving success on their own; we need only to make your life interesting and full, learn to understand their desires and achieve their performance.

<br>2. I can't choose the right partner<br>

If how develop a romantic relationship of Fish that do not meet their expectations, members of this sign tend to blame their partner and adverse coincidence of circumstances, but are willing to admit that they made a serious mistake, which became the victim of a painful affection. 

Many Fish can't feel happy without being in love, and are sometimes willing to indulge every one who enters the field of view. Neither considerations of common sense, or the instinct of self-preservation do not have over them sufficient power to keep the relationship obviously complex and non-structural harmony. The euphoria experienced by Fish lovers, forcing them to close their eyes to the shortcomings of the elect; adding to this a developed ability to sympathize and empathize, we understand why the representatives of this sign is often associated with people weak, unable to resist the temptations and bad habits, fear of challenges. The sad paradox is that Fish subconsciously seek Union with man strong!

In order to avoid errors, each of which can have a serious impact on your life, you need to learn to listen to your inner voice, to understand their own desires and aspirations. It is very important that the person with whom you associate yourself more or less serious relationships, possess a constructive Outlook on life, ability to stand – and yours, if need be! interests, solve existing problems and not to spend time on psychological manipulation, the victim will be you. Learn not to confuse pity and love and remember: the one who looks helpless, can indeed be a shameless consumer of your energy.

<br>3. He does not justify my expectations<br>

Many Fish, especially the young, are not endowed with realism emotionally. In other words, from the romantic relationship they are waiting for something special, breathtaking and having nothing in common with everyday life. When choosing a partner and the representatives of this sign are not in a hurry to part with the pink glasses, and being assured that the feeling will last forever and will never change, work themselves into a dead end.

Fish manages to combine the two desires: the desire to engage in a romantic relationship as soon as possible and find the ideal partner. Your imagination can play a cruel joke with you, forcing you to see the ideal in absolutely the wrong person – born and false, based on nothing waiting. Try to be pickier, listen to your inner voice: when your propensity to strong and deep feelings wrong choice can prove to be truly dangerous.

If you feel that the relationship with you dear man stalled due to unrealistic expectations, try to appeal to the senses and to logic and common sense – they can be very useful! Reflecting on what is happening, you have the chance to come to interesting conclusions and find a way out and regret and sadness, coupled with inaction would lead to more depression than happiness.

<br>4. He often offends me<br>

Fish are vulnerable – this ought to warn anyone who deals with them, and in a romantic relationship Pisces doubly vulnerable. Well, if your partner treats you with care and carefully, but even the most careful person can accidentally hurt you, not wishing that. The difficulty lies in the fact that the Fish, always eager to display their emotions, tend not to voice their causes, and leads to the repetition of unpleasant, painful situations. Fearful that they will be completely defenseless in front of your partner, you are hiding behind a wall of silence when constructive dialogue could give good results.

Those who aspire to harmony in a romantic relationship, have to learn to articulate their desires, to Express thoughts clearly and precisely, avoiding allusions and innuendo. Even if you love a person who, like you, is configured with the intuitive perception of a partner, you need to make some effort to be on the same wavelength, what can we say about the Union with those who are not good at interpreting subtle signs of discontent.

You will not interfere with the ability to say "no" to a partner and justify their point – believe me, it is much easier than silently doing something that you think is inappropriate. Should be combated and an extreme sensitivity to criticism, and a good helper in this case will be a developed sense of humor.

<br>5. He doesn't trust me<br>

As human beings are emotional, prone to deep feelings and complex natures, Fish hardly believe that not all are surrounding. Partner does not with you long philosophical conversations, share worries and experiences, does not analyze all aspects of their feelings? This does not mean that your choice has fallen on indifferent person, secretive and suspicious.

Notice how much attention many of your acquaintances paid to practical issues – those on which you sometimes do not pay attention. Perhaps your partner also attaches considerable the value of the business, not geeky you have a genuine interest, and not discuss them with you merely because they do not want to make you bored.

Fish more than other signs tend to want to know about your partner absolutely everything, to penetrate into the farthest recesses of his soul. This is dictated not proprietary instincts, and sincere interest. It is important that you understand how important can be the little things – and therefore do not want to leave them out.

If you want from the partner a greater degree of trust and openness – don't be afraid to ask him, sincerely be interested in his Affairs. Your behavior is unlikely to seem Intrusive, since the natural tact of Fish almost never changes.

<br>6. Our relationship is boring<br>

Fish tend not so much to the diversity in a romantic relationship, much to the depth and fullness of the senses. The stability and predictability of encouraging representatives of this sign, but sometimes they become obsessed with the desire for change, the desire to situations that will provoke the appearance of bright emotions, violent reaction partner. Fish that do not have sufficient life experience, this desire can lead to reckless acts, even infidelity or separation from a loved one – just because the lack of significant events seems unbearable. Not always easy to reconcile with the fact that the passion, love, or dizzying novel is, in fact, only part of the relationship that the representatives of this sign are so highly valued.

Meanwhile, in your power to make your life more rich and varied, without resorting to outside help. Take the time to forget about your Hobbies, if their partner does not share, and immerse yourself in the things that impress you, just because they are interested in your vote. 

Because of their personalities, you tend to immerse yourself in a romantic relationship with the head, expecting similar from your partner. However, whether or not to limit my world only one person, even the most wonderful? 

Look for additional sources of pleasant emotions, and, most importantly, don't be afraid to take the initiative. To cope with the role of the only source of joy and light in the window is not given to everyone, and it is likely that, expecting something similar from the elect, you want too much. In addition, we have to admit that even in the most loving couple emotional needs of the partners may be different, and someone with whom you have dedicated your life, does not even know what is the cause of your discomfort. Voice your desires, but do not complain about boredom, otherwise partner can come to the conclusion that you have simply lost interest.

<br>7. I'm not sure of the seriousness of our relationship<br>

Fish fall in love easily and, once you know more or less strong feeling, beginning to dream about the future. Your imagination is rich and generous on a picture perfect life together, but we have to admit that they rarely have something in common with reality. Is it possible to talk about a serious relationship with someone you do not really know? And how can we reproach the man, barely dared the first step to intimacy with us that he is not serious?

Don't forget that all relationships, including romantic, evolving in time and with the time change. They may seem to to anything not binding in the beginning, but become much more serious once you and your partner will be truly worth. You should learn to think not only about the future but about the present, evaluating their actions and the actions of a loved one. Not always the seriousness of the relationship is determined by the willingness to enter into marriage or spending all your free time. 

Fish do not differ in their confidence, and that's why they think that people around them do not appreciate. Believe that you have the dignity that simply cannot go unnoticed to those who love you, and do not look dramatic experiences where they don't even have a reason. You know perfectly well that your charm can inspire many, whence doubt that your multi-faceted nature can cause deep, sincere and serious interest.

Finally, be a little happier and more optimistic. You enter into a romantic relationship, expecting from them the joys and not worries and anxieties, isn't it?
