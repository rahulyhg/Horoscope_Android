Virgo – the passive sign, which is characteristic of rather subtle perception of life than a storm of activity changes. This does not mean that virgin are weak, their strength is just to confront the real difficulties, not to fight with windmills.

The outward calm of the virgin usually lies a strong anxiety; the people of this sign often doubt the correctness of their actions and await punishment for a long time committed and forgotten all errors. In General, overly developed sense of responsibility – is the scourge of the Virgins. They seem willing to take the blame for all the troubles of the world and don't understand that sometimes a drop of irresponsibility and frivolity can make them truly happy.

Virgin easy to meet people and pleasant to talk to, but at heart they are still single, in addition to prefer entertainment work, so those closest to you are among colleagues or colleagues on social activities.

My most powerful experiences tend to hide from others even those virgins that are normally open to communication. Cause mental anguish of the virgin can be a made it or someone else mistake, and the best way to forget about the pain for people of this sign is to help the man who does not take care of himself.

Insight of the virgin is manifested in all areas of life, but is particularly striking when they evaluate the welfare of others: a person born under this sign, do not deceive nor ostentatious luxury or false wealth.

The earth and bring its blessings are interested in Virgins with more scientific and theoretical point of view, since the potential for people of this sign is more important than the practical implementation.

The people of the virgin are volatile, but talk is rather uniform motion than static nature of their nature. In addition, with the desire to earthly blessings of the virgin is hiding a tremendous need for mental improvement.

</p><strong>HEALTH</strong><p>

Virgo is not especially painful, but prone to hypochondria. They work too much, almost no rest and often abuse alcohol, but even this is not the most serious problem. Much worse is the fact that the virgin brand do not spare your sensitive nervous system, not letting her rest and peace. Hard to say what hurts more Virgins – excessive load or constant pessimism.
This Dev will not be accused of indifference to their health: they visit doctors and humbly, even meticulously fulfill all their requirements, of course, if it does not interfere with work. How many doctors would not recommend virgin to relax – all people of this sign will work until he has enough power.

</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>


Virgo is often called the wisest sign of the Zodiac. It was under his influence are born people, where more capacity for analytical work, endowed with a critical attitude and an ability to identify far from obvious causation. Alas, criticality Virgins sometimes backfires on them. It is the representatives of this sign are known as if you don't give yourself the chance to be happy, again and again, finding in their partner or in the relationship itself with it deficiencies that must be corrected at all costs. So love becomes work, which brings less and less satisfaction.

Virgos are very important to learn when to relax and give yourself a rest. Concern for the welfare of the whole world – it is tedious and, I must admit, ungrateful. Sometimes it is necessary to solve their own problems or even forget about the difficulties and enjoy life, as it can do, for example, Lions.

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. I can't find a suitable partner<br>

The virgin is hard to find your soul mate not because of the requirements it to a potential partner, too high. The problem is that you too can see their own flaws and often feel unworthy of love or attention of a person. It is the virgin, often suffer from inferiority complex, again and again, adding fuel to his fire. Change policy – praise yourself, love yourself, do not belittle his merits and think less about the annoying trifles.

In addition, you should be honest with yourself: is very important to understand what you really want out of life. Sometimes you may need the help of a friend in order to understand this, but the efforts will not be in vain – in the end you will understand, strive for, and to find a partner according to your expectations and needs, it will be easier.

<br>2. He doesn't understand me<br>

Virgos tend to hide their inherent romanticism, and so they often produce a false impression. Do not try to look cool and calm, if you have strong feelings, don't be afraid to let loose.

Frequently the partner of the virgin has no idea about her feelings and therefore would hurt them again and again without noticing it. It is for this reason virgin are very unhappy, although by their loving unions look highly stable and harmonious. 

Learning to relax, to drop the mask of moderation and composure, you will feel much happier.

<br>3. We love each other, but often quarrel<br>

Probably, it's due to this different attitude to life you and your partner. The nature of Virgo is flexible and the one who has to deal with the representative of this sign, usually forced to give in and adapt. 
You know what you want, and are rarely distracted. Partner may see you as a tough leader giving orders, not be discussed. 

There are two qualities that you should take control – possessive and unwillingness to change anything in your life. Because of them you find it difficult to get along with people who show a modicum of independence and striving for change – and they are the majority.

Remember, it is not so important to learn to yield in the dispute, but to acknowledge the very existence of another point of view on a particular issue. The sooner you do, the sooner things will go smoothly.

<br>4. I was lonely.<br>

Virgo most of the other characters spend their lives in loneliness and sometimes does not experience discomfort because of this. If you still want to change the situation, you should overcome the fear of failure in love relationships, but also recognize that you need love, no less than other characters. Virgos are usually quite easy to make new friends and find friends; difficulties arise at a time when the relationship become romantic phase. Sometimes you need to make an effort to overcome inhibitions and become closer to someone you care about get over it and decide on the first step.

Virgin, whose intentions are to unattainable heights, may feel alone and in pairs, if the partner does not share their aspirations and interests. Not always you can share what is on your mind, and not always your partner can understand you; but a genuine emotional attachment, a real deep sense helps to cope with this problem, although it does not eliminate all difficulties. 

<br>5. He doesn't appreciate my efforts<br>

Representatives of many Zodiac signs are perceived romantic relationship as something natural that does not require internal stresses. But the virgin does not are: for they love is a labor, followed by the reward.

In a romantic relationship of the virgin giving a lot of myself and demand a lot, including their priorities – devotion, care and respect. However, does your partner what you expect from him? Perhaps not: you too often Express their discontent in a form that allows you to receive a rebuke or criticism for not too good a joke. 

Creative imagination and find way to give your partner to understand what, exactly, you want from him – it's possible that he is ready to fulfill your desires.

Also keep in mind that your requirements are very high and can many unpleasant surprise. If you are ready to work on a troubled relationship, the first thing you should learn is lenient to his partner, who may well have not only advantages, but also some weaknesses. The Union will be the stronger and the more harmonious, the more you appreciate in her choice of man, which has its own unique characteristics, and not just the faults that detach his ideal.

<br>6. I doubt the sincerity of his partner<br>

The habit of doubting everything and to trust only very reliable sources often makes life easier for the Dev, but in his personal life, alas, sometimes seriously interfere with them. Even those who seemingly have no reason to doubt the loyalty of the partner or suspect him in the artful weaving of intrigue, unable to find peace, again and again checking the obvious. Of course, nobody likes to be deceived, but to continue to expect a trap, unable to relax, this is not good. 

In a romantic relationship it is especially hard for those Virgos who already have a negative experience: they tirelessly blow on water, scalded milk, but deprive themselves of many pleasures of life.

In order to overcome the problem of distrust and feel more comfortable in a romantic relationship, you need to learn when to get rid of tension and alertness, and time to stop fertilize the soil for doubt. Remember that nature has given you two very useful features – amazing intuition and a clear, almost non-error logic. However, if the second you use often enough, we first prefer to ignore; in vain – the inner voice is unlikely to deceive you.

Often The Virgin, unable to trust the man whom they themselves have chosen, arrange your partner a variety of tests, showing ingenuity worthy of a better cause. To anything good it does not – the relationship does not become closer, and that means genuine peace of mind can only dream about.

Learn to trust – and, above all, yourself, own choice, the decision yourself and then to partner. It will be useful not only in romantic relationships but in life in General because it will allow you not to waste energy on doubts and concerns, and to obtain fun and to enjoy the gifts that are brought by fate.

<br>7. We love each other, but the relationship became boring and monotonous<br>

Hand on heart, the virgin is not so need to change. Stability and predictability is sometimes very pleasant, isn't it? But sometimes you want some variety, new experiences and unforgettable impressions. Such problems hardly occurs in those whose partner is not only your loved one but also adherent, as in this case, common interests allow us to move forward together, expanding horizons.

But even then, the lucky ones will not prevent a few simple tips that will be very useful to others.

Be at least sometimes frivolous and fun, fool around, forget about worries – sometimes this is enough to thoroughly cut you sparkled like a diamond.

You will not lose anything if you do a deeper study of the sensory areas of life. This is especially important for those whose partner is by nature endowed with a strong temperament and can suffer from a lack opportunities to vent their sexual energy.

Finally, do not neglect the high life, even if events seem uninviting and not too noteworthy: most likely, you just don't give yourself the opportunity to appreciate its positive aspects.
