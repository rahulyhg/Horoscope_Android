Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. "I can't find the right partner"<br>

Despite the fact that the social circle of the Bulls is quite broad, it is not so easy to find the person with whom the representatives of this sign would be closer and (especially!) to create a family. Others may say that your expectations are too high, but you don't think so.

Indeed, the choice of a partner, even potential, you get very seriously. There is nothing shameful or reprehensible in the end, you find someone who meets your requirements, and have every right to do! However, a few to adjust its approach to the problem still stands. Remember that people change and maybe that relationship with you will become someone great incentive to succeed in everything. 

It is important that you and your partner have common goals – your intuition enough to understand whether future together with those who at present does not seem ideal to you elect. Allow yourself to look ahead and keep in mind that to achieve success sometimes it is easier – it would wish.

Another aspect of the problem is that Cells can be surrounded by people who will stop at nothing to gain his favor – but no choice, because we see only the disadvantages of each. The solution is simple: try to focus on the merits of the contenders for your heart. The commendable clarity, and objectivity but sometimes will not hurt.

Common and this situation</p><p> Dating a wonderful man who appreciates his moral qualities and intellectual abilities, admired his achievements but there feels to this wonderful personality of sexual interest. The fact that the influence of Venus makes you pay much attention to appearance, both your own and your potential partner. You are more susceptible to beauty, and it hurts you especially any imperfection. This is one of the properties of your character and the only thing you can do is to maximize their aesthetic horizons". It is not excluded, what's your sense of beauty is formed, for example, stereotypes or certain impressions received in childhood. The more diverse your ideas of beauty and harmony, the more attractive people you will see around.

<br>2. "I doubt I made the right choice"<br>

It would seem that you have met the perfect person, but the further develop the relationship, the less the partner meets your expectations. He's doing something wrong, or asking too many questions, keeps faithful faithful habits, ignores your advice...

It is unlikely that you may have overlooked some significant shortcomings of their potential partner, when making the choice: Taureans are very attentive and at the initial stage of the relationship, and "preparatory" when the case has not yet come is not something that is prior to the first bouquet, and even exchange smiles. So, stop blaming yourself incorrectly adopted the decision, and his choice – in all or some mortal sins, and try to understand why he does things, so annoying you.

Taureans love to direct, and the true cause of your dissatisfaction may be the feeling that you again and again meet a decent response. Concessions and compromises are sometimes insufficient to harmony: try to give your partner a little more independence.

Sometimes to doubt the correctness of the choice made Taurus makes not so much disappointment in your partner, but in the relationship itself – for example, what started as perfect relationship becomes a series of reproaches and quarrels. You feel unappreciated, trapped in the narrow confines deprived of the opportunity to act. In a word, miserable.

The cause of the problems can be conservatism and stubbornness peculiar to you. Even if you find "the" person, the relationship may not correspond to the pattern that has always existed in your head though, because it can have its own schema and to act in accordance with her! You're far from ready to give up their own habits and inclinations. So, try to Express your wishes in a valid form, and acknowledge that the criticism in your address can be constructive. You really are able not only to get along with the most "difficult" person, but and get genuine pleasure from communication – you need only a little try!

<br>3. "I'm doing something wrong"<br>

Taureans have developed intuition and always feel that if their partner is unhappy about something. But to find the cause of this phenomenon is quite difficult; instead enjoy the company of a loved one, you begin to look for mistakes in your own behavior, not knowing that I was treading on a dangerous path. To withdraw into themselves in similar situations did not.

Taureans usually pay much attention to resolving material issues, appreciate the comfort in the home and financial independence, but the mental comfort from their field of vision is slipping. Therefore, feeling that the partner does not feel happy, many representatives of this sign are thinking primarily about practical things, not even knowing that the cause of all ills may lie in their increased attention to the material world.

Great interest in the work of his partner, show more attention to his mood, ask about the plans and dreams – believe me, for many people they are very important. It is likely that it will be easier to reach an understanding, if you're not going to find definitive answers to all questions, but will leave a bit of vagueness and some "room for manoeuvre". By the way, is not always necessary to keep the situation under strict control – sometimes it helps to relax that tension decreased and resolution of any problems was achievable and simple.

<br>4. Romantic relationships are formed not so as we would like<br>

Taurus reasonable and sensible, they know what they want, and know how to achieve it – but in a romantic relationship, alas, do not always know how to apply these wonderful qualities. Even if the partner is willing to cooperate with you, his actions may seem unreasonable and inappropriate, and that will cause irritation and lead to quarrels. Another cause of discomfort can be your too demanding to her beloved, waiting for the deeds that he is not typical.

It is important to learn in time and in a tactful manner to inform the partner about their desires, but it is also helpful to be prepared self-care of meeting their needs. And remember that with our own, extremely exciting and important things, you sometimes do not give your loved one enough attention, creating the feeling that your life allotted him only a modest supporting role.

It should also be borne in mind that "love" and "own" is not the same thing. Taurus have some inherent authority, and sometimes they are not able to recognize that the partner has a right to personal space, which may be required as a condition of harmonious development relations. Not so important, are you married or just Dating – your partner is not your property has its own desires, aspirations and dreams; otherwise, he hardly would have caused you a sincere interest.

If your relationship is serious and trustworthy, is to talk openly with your partner, discuss expectations and wants each of you. To compromise is not always easy, but in most cases probably not forget that the reward for concessions will be harmony in the relationship.

<br>5. Cute people I don't do steps to convergence<br>

Taurus, not sure about the feelings of a man who captivated his heart (or just the calling of special interest) becomes a skillful strategist. Representatives of this sign are well aware that you need to start a romantic relationship, and find many ways to create the necessary conditions. Usually they quickly abandon the hopeless struggle, but in cases where reciprocal sympathy seems to be there, and go to a closer relationship fails, is lost. 

Try to act easier – sometimes the hints and flirting powerless, but an unexpected invitation or explicit recognition of acts irresistible. There is another possible scenario: sometimes you are so fond of their own maneuvers and focus on the expected development of the situation, that simply do not notice the actions of the elect who do not match your expectations. In other words, hoping to get invited on a romantic date, you are missing the opportunity to communicate in an informal setting, to exchange views on relevant both to the issue. Sometimes just relax and be yourself, that rapprochement was possible to tune in a less serious mood and try to re-assess the situation.

Finally, some Taureans stubbornly conquer the fortress, which would have cost be avoided. Think about what is happening – not whether happened such that in a situation allowing you to start the approach, you are lost and not find the right words? It is not excluded that such a strange way, the subconscious is warning you that the wrong choice is made, and the beginning of a relationship will not lead to anything good. Something that shines very much, may not even be gold plated, and later you will be glad that the case has gone beyond a mere hobby.

<br>6. Unrequited love ruined my life<br>

Taurus experience severe discomfort after the break with a partner, even if the relationship was not serious and deep. If we are talking about really strong feelings, it may come to a depression, complete loss of interest in people and hopes for happiness. Representatives of this sign are always very seriously choose a partner, if the relationship did not work out, blame yourself that you made a mistake.

On the one hand, you feel uncomfortable alone and aim for the beginning of a new relationship, with another – you don't like it and fear to make the wrong choice is not conducive to to change the situation. Remembering his bad experience, you promise yourself this time to be even more careful, cautious and careful, and sometimes alienate those who could be enthusiastic about. Some representatives of the sign is build around a completely impenetrable wall of grievances and complaints, negative, pessimistic attitude towards the world, not allowing yourself to enjoy life and receive the gifts that are ready to present destiny.

Remember that you have all the chances to find happiness – such is the influence of the planets. Now for you it is important to maintain confidence and not to focus on the search ideal. To protect yourself from unpleasant experiences, and developing relationships requires the same seriousness as their beginning.

Not worth doing the search for the perfect partner as its main goal. Lead an active life, enjoy communication and be more open. It is enough to let events take their course, that all came together as it should. Not to forget about the past, but also to dive into it head first, ignoring the present and not giving chances to the future, in no event it is impossible.

<br>7. He is not proactive in the relationship<br>

Taurus demanding. Being by nature a people strong and able to share their emotions, and they strive to receive no less than they give. Beginning of a romantic relationship forces them to believe that the attention of the partner will not subside for a minute, and his interest in their persona will always be extremely strong. However, already at this stage, there is a disorder, because sometimes, trying to be pleasant to your partner and to please him, you don't feel the response.

The cause of discomfort at the beginning of the novel, when the partners are unfamiliar with each other, may be increased attention Taurus in physical proximity. Let your partner know that you are also interesting and spiritual contact, otherwise full understanding is not achieved. In addition, at this stage can be helpful and reduce the level of requests of a material nature. Dating in luxurious restaurants and hikes in the hip place is lovely, however your partner they may seem not as exciting as "democratic" a walk in the Park – don't regard this as a lack of interest in his own person.

When the relationship becomes more serious, the Bulls are doing a lot to help people close to them was happy and satisfied, and deeply worried, if you do not receive neither the attention nor gratitude. Indeed, it can be considered fair by the fact that on your shoulders lie the responsibility for developing relationships, solving everyday issues, resolving financial problems, while the partner remains only to enjoy.
