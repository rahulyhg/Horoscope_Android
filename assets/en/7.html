The ability of the Scales to predict the future a striking, especially in combination with their easy, not overshadowed mystical premonitions character. They seem to be lucky and cheerful, always open to communication, but the nature of Scales contradictory, and in some periods of life, they become real monsters.

The dark side of Libra is so unattractive, how attractive light part of their identity. Becoming sometimes capricious, nervous and just plain nasty, people run the risk of losing friends, got used to see them quite different.

Non-permanent Scales and in lifestyle: activity and indefatigability followed by periods of complete apathy when nothing to interest or inspire. With the exception, perhaps, of a book: read Libra love always, and thanks to its unique ability to concentrate, even from acquaintance with complex scientific works have great fun.

Scales, knowledgeable about the fickleness of their character, try rational approach to life and to make informed decisions, but often, without knowing it, fall under the influence of others, and do things, which they are to others. What Scales is lacking is the ability to trust their own intuition. Having learned it, they will be able to avoid many important errors.

</p><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL PORTRAIT</strong><p>

Libra is an active sign, however, people born under it, does not have enough energy to overcome the influence of the environment and prefer to escape in an open and bitter struggle. Having enough power to implement any solution that Scales too much time spend on them to take, considering various options and conditions, and in the end losing time that is optimal for this or that deed. To convince a person of this sign to act quickly is possible, but then he will do everything possible to absolve themselves of responsibility for what is happening.

But when the decision is made, Scales usually do not depart from the choices made and intuitively allocate effort so that to achieve the goals in order of importance. It is particularly important that the Scales do not deviate from the chosen path, as if oblivious to their surrounding temptations.

Actively participating in disputes and debates, the balance is not so much to defend his point of view, but enjoy intellectual match; sometimes they provoke conflicts just to be able to protect themselves from enemy attacks.

In periods when their energy is weakening, the Scales turn in on themselves, become taciturn and closed. They seem to hoard power for a new breakthrough that is sure to be thought out and meticulously planned, although it may be a little late.

</p><strong>THE ELEMENT OF THE SIGN</strong><p>

The element of Libra Is Air, giving their character not only to some variability, but also the elusiveness. Libra don't like to trust someone blindly or to belong entirely; they prefer invisibly present at any time having the ability to disappear in an unknown direction.

Your friends and relatives people of this sign like envelop gentle cloud unobtrusive attention, which turns into a black and suffocating smoke, when the Weights in a bad mood.

Libra get knowledge like from the air, to learn and comprehend new for them is as natural as breathing. The information obtained no burden life Weights: all the unpleasant and disturbing in their minds easily dissipated like the morning mist.

</p><strong>HEALTH</strong><p>

Scales usually are not able to complain neither mental nor physical health and try to protect yourself from unnecessary stress and overwork. However, the propensity for privacy during the difficult periods of life sometimes leads them to depression, which, in turn, hit the weak points of the Weights of the liver and kidneys.
Suffer the Scales, especially those who cannot avoid physical work, from back pain, and often very strong. Others pay for hard work acute headaches that seem to defy treatment, but for quite a long time disappear as if by themselves.

Among Weights almost no thin people; many of them suffer from overeating and lack of interest in sports, while others pay with their health for excessive love of alcohol.

</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>

Scales are rarely catastrophically unhappy in his personal life – at least if it depends on them. Representatives of this sign is too cautious to make a fatal mistake or acts about which we will regret. However, sometimes discretion is bordered by indecision and you spend a lot of time looking for the answer to a simple and, in fact, not worthy of attention.

In a romantic relationship tendency of yours for a long time to think about any decision can have serious repercussions. On the one hand, it allows you not to offend my partner over nothing and not to repent acts committed rashly, on the other – often deprives you of opportunities to be active, time to steer developments in the right direction. In the worst case you face a very unpleasant choice – either tacitly endorse the actions of the elect, whom you do not have time to stop, or to leave a person just because he makes decisions faster than you.

You should learn to speak as often as the leader and "first person". Too often, allowing the partner to guide your actions, you forget – and in vain! that could take some share of responsibility for the development of relationships that you value.

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. Cabinfever<br>

Libra is one of those signs of the Zodiac, the representatives of which are extremely strong desire to search for "his half"; they do not like and do not know how to be alone unlike, for example, Women who find this kind of fun. Scales usually feel extremely uncomfortable if forced for a while to break up with a partner – you can imagine how hard it is for those who have not met the man who would be called romantic feelings.

The mistake many Weights that, striving for the beginning of the relationship in theory, in practice I prefer to wait patiently for a favorable situation, nothing making for her coming. If someone is lucky enough to interest you, you will surely find a lot of reasons to avoid Dating or rapprochement, fearing rejection or other adverse developments. In fact, in many cases, the development of relations is possible only due to the fact that the initiative shows the person on whom you choose. Should be stronger and not be afraid to make the first step; don't forget that the world will not collapse even if you get rejected.

You often leads an overly serious attitude to relations that do not yet exist; thus, the reluctance to go on a date with an interested person may be associated with anxiety about how you will get along together, or find a common language when it is necessary to solve financial problems. Sometimes it is not necessary to look so far ahead; the rest in the company of a nice person doesn't make you marry or live together. Learn to trust fate and let events take their course – the results of this approach will not take long.

<br>2. I can't find a suitable partner<br>

Libra, after spending some time alone and desperate to find someone who would make them genuine interest, sometimes become involved in a completely hopeless, and sometimes even painful and destructive communication. Not daring to take the initiative in order to get closer to someone worthy, you fall into simple traps set by those who love and know how to command. At first nothing happens – what's more, you can enjoy the fact that there was a man of strong and resolute, ready to lead you. But the disappointment is almost immediate; realizing that the choice was made incorrectly, the Scales are not in a hurry to end the relationship, preferring to endure and suffer. When the situation becomes unbearable, the Scales make the plunge, and suffer again – this time from loneliness.

In order to break the vicious circle, you should determine their desires and needs. Banal advice to love yourself is not so bad as it might seem at first glance, but you need to know yourself, to understand their deep emotional needs. Assistance in this difficult matter can have something that Scales both sexes endowed as a female intuition and male logic; you are required to use this weapon to his advantage.

If you strive for harmonious relationships and is based not only on love, but on mutual respect, you should learn to respect themselves and to use the forces which have given you the nature. There is no need to grasp at first emotional backup, if you have enough of your own energy and perseverance – keep this in mind and resist the temptation to engage in a relationship that will not bring you anything but a moment of satisfaction because you are not alone.

<br>3. We love each other, but I don't feel happy(Vym)<br>

The scales have some inherent emotional immaturity, which prevents the development of harmonious relations, even if sincere partners love each other. Representatives of this sign leaves no concern that any relationship requires responsibility of both parties; fears that sooner or later have to make a decision, the consequences of which cannot be predicted, able to overshadow any novel. If you're young, take the time to dive into the romantic abyss until you are sure that is self-sufficient and independent in decision making; the Scales of a more Mature age we should not forget about what is in their power to combat the negative trends, and not to accept the situation that causes emotional discomfort.

In some cases, Scales, faced with this situation, so deeply immersed in self-analysis and finding the root of all problems that become completely unreachable for the partner. Replaced the vague feeling of "lack of happiness" comes a very real wall separating the family and loving each other people. You should rather think about what is missing for complete peace of mind than to worry about the cause of discomfort – this can be things very, very different.

An indispensable condition of happiness of a couple is a sense of inner harmony of each of its participants, but to achieve it alone not necessarily. If you have no reason to doubt that the partner has been selected correctly and you are not a victim of his manipulations, tell us openly about what is bothering you, but do not stop work. In addition, use all possible opportunities to realize their ideas, implement ideas and approaches to the implementation of cherished desires.

<br>4. We don't understand each other<br>

Face this problem even Scales, trusting your partner completely and unconditionally, openly telling everything that happens in their soul, and sincerely recognized in their desires. Sometimes resentment arise from the fact that your words, it seems quite straightforward and understandable, are not proper actions; one gets the impression that the partner is simply skips them by the ears.

The fact that the Scales usually impress people cold-blooded and calculating, and completely unemotional. Watch how you talk about your feelings – whether not too it looks like on research paper, interesting but rather dry and not able to captivate the unprepared case. The speech of most people are emotionally charged, but Libra is peculiar to a lesser extent than the others. Partner also your peace of mind may seem like a sign of lack of interest in the subject, or a complete unwillingness to discuss it. Don't be afraid to accentuate, not avoid disputes and discussions, no matter how tedious they may seem is the only way to give your partner to understand that in your relationship there are moments that are not perfect.

The ability to peacekeeping is strong suit of Scales, but side effect is the sacrifice of the representatives of this sign. In the end, you are again inferior to his elect, subconsciously expecting him to respond – and he does not even know how expensive cost you peace and harmony!

<br>5. I feel like a victim of its partner<br>

Scales are endowed with sufficient mental strength and emotional stability, but one known reason, prefer to forget about it when it comes to love. Unable to stand the loneliness and trying to avoid confrontations Scales are desirable prey for manipulators of all kinds; and because they are also smart and sensitive, psychological games with them is very exciting. Of course, it is not necessary to suspect the elect in malice and all mortal sins, if you suddenly notice that all too often go the way he expects you, and completely forgot about my own desires and aspirations. It's possible that your partner is passionate about only one thing – caring about your well-being, as he understood it.

This issue is complex, and its solution will take time. You should start with the analysis of the situation in which you must help both logic and intuition. Rate your partner, not avoiding criticism and not letting emotions influence your thoughts, try to find the cause of his behavior and decide whether to openly discuss the situation. In some cases, it may seem too difficult – then you should start with small things, defending their interests, not to avoid disputes, persistence and dedication. The most emotionally vulnerable and defenseless Scales sometimes choose the retaliatory tactics of manipulation, the power for which is derived from his own weakness. Be very careful if you set foot on this path, and try to roll with it, if possible – otherwise you risk to confuse the situation so difficult.

<br>6. I can't time to end the relationship, which I do not like<br>

Libra quickly fall in love and often associated itself conjugal ties, especially not pondering where this may lead. The decision to breakup is always given to the representatives of this sign is difficult especially confusing is the situation if partner and reproaching the nothing – except that he's not perfect, of course.

Remember that a relationship requires the ability to make decisions and stick to them, and tear them – one of those moments when innate peacefulness can lead to a dead end. You have a right to happiness, even if not every step you approve of others; the decision to "stay friends" that fits many couples, for you would hardly be acceptable, because the guilt or will always overshadow such a friendship, or make you go back again to the relationship that you wanted to interrupt. 

Do not expect that the situation will resolve itself; in this situation, you need action. Be considerate, do not hurt the man she loved, but also not too blame – it is likely that you yourself believe that you are the cause of all evils. 

Finally, promise yourself in a new relationship will not repeat the same mistakes; the belief that the future will reveal in front of you the way to happiness in your personal life, will help to make a difficult decision.

<br>7. I can't concentrate on the relationship with one person<br>

Sometimes the Scales, even marrying, secretly know that it will not be long, and admit the possibility of the soon appearing on their horizon that person, for which they break up with their current partner. For representatives of this sign "seriousness" of the relationship is more likely connected with calmness and temporary sense of security, than with the intention to continue them for a long time. 

It should also be added that, although the initial period of a romantic relationship Libra is not easy, much worse than they have in a time when a fling becomes a serious novel. Everyday cares and problem – not the most suitable element for Libra, they are interested in much more dramatic and memorable moments. In order to be happy, you have to learn the practicality and overcoming small troubles, otherwise, when faced with any difficulty, you will think about what the other partner would be much happier, and then take appropriate action. This tactic may seem attractive, but is unlikely to give good results; you run the risk of becoming entangled in a series of relationships, none of which are truly harmonious.

</p><strong>CAREER AND PROFESSION</strong><p>

Physical labor in any form Libra is absolutely contraindicated: this token generates thinkers, not workers. Excessive load rather undermine health Scales than will increase their viability.

Much better than the Weights given commercial activity, but brilliant businessmen usually prevents them to become modest interest in money and no bulldog business acumen. In addition, the market often requires quick decisions to take which Scales extremely difficult.

But the ability to reason rationally and assess the situation from different angles makes the Scales very useful in lawmaking and social activities. Generally, and loving being able to think about the future in detail, they usually become great designers, science fiction writers or scientists and futurologists.

Weights should choose a narrow specialization, as a broad activity profile negatively affects their intellectual abilities. Having a tendency to medicine, people born under this sign will be a great specialist in his field, but outside it will feel insecure.

Career Scales usually develops unevenly, presenting a series of UPS and downs, but with very small amplitude, and smooth transitions. Scales are usually endowed with creative potential, but to elect service often prevents them, for example, the memory of the artists whose genius the world has noticed too late. Fear of poverty and obscurity, Scales usually choose a more practical lesson, and, due to the ability to deeply study the subject and to accumulate knowledge, to succeed.

</p><strong>SEXUALITY SIGN</strong><p>

Charming, smiling and very beautiful, Libra conquer others is easy, but hard addicted themselves. They tend to choose meticulously partner and not to rush into the arms of the first who will beckon you. Even being in love, Libra remain selfish at heart, but it's like it attracts more and more new victims.
Erotic life of Libra is a work of art: they are able to enjoy all that give a sexual relationship, while not yielding to a reckless passion. Sometimes Scales have several novels simultaneously, but not because of promiscuity, and desiring to choose the bestpartner.

Sometimes the Scales do not refuse sexual relations, even if their feelings for a long time and hopelessly faded: with his usual resourcefulness, they find the arguments proving that to part with once a loved one too early. In addition, Scales are, by nature, normally not a violent person, so I prefer not to cause suffering even to those who had fallen out of love.

Love failures Libra happen quite often, though, because they are too common talk where we need to act. But the people of this sign have the enviable ability to not take seriously romantic disappointment, at least because they usually have somebody to be comforted.

</p><strong>MARRIAGE AND COMPATIBILITY</strong><p>

Libra have the ability to love, but seldom happy in marriage: they are too long pondering over any of his actions and analyze every word chosen, finding in it a second or even a third meaning, which, of course, not invested.

Another enemy of Weights in matters of the heart - their insistence. They crave happiness complete, absolute and reckless, while tirelessly in relationships finding occasions for grief and disappointments.

Generally, Scales, usually having a wide circle of friends, and love relationships are build on the principle of friendly, preferring intellectual partnership, and not blind support of a life partner in any situations. Found among the Weights and really stale mentally people are able to humiliate and offend even a loved one; they are guided by the best of intentions and any criticisms considered unreasonable. There are among Scales and the people that surround your partner affection and attention, but don't forget about your own interests and try to invest in a life together is not more power and money than they receive in return. Sacrifice not typical Libra, how much they were in love.

The most difficult for Libra usually are the first years of marriage, especially if their heart took over strong and solid. Over time, the difference in the characters is smoothed, but the Scales, as if for old time's sake, continue to wait for the catch, this tiring himself and his chosen one.

The Union of two people born under the sign of Libra, it's not that bad, but it is unlikely that both will be too long to doubt, and, most likely, no one dare to take the first step.

Bad Union with the Twins: the changeability of one partner, and endless other variations do not contribute to heart harmony.

Libra will be able to balance the energy of Scorpio, and in some cases - to decorate a lonely life of a vicious Cancer.

</p><strong>CULINARY PREFERENCES</strong><p>

Scales mostly foodies, lovers of good wines and sweet. You would not reproach them neither gluttony nor promiscuity. However, choosing Scales is usually not what is useful for them. For example, refuse the bread of coarse grinding in favor of cakes and pastries, aromatic herbs and spices prefer greasy spicy sauces, stews and smoked sausage. 
Libra you need to ensure that their diet also seafood, greens, meat, rich in potassium and sodium cherry juice.

</p><strong>CHILDREN'S HOROSCOPE</strong><p>

Children-Libra bring a lot of joy to parents and other relatives, but the hassle almost not deliver. They are sensible, obedient, careful and diligent, are usually in a good mood, from a young age have a pleasant sense of humor and delicacy. The only serious problem lies in their unwillingness (or even inability) to take decisions on their own. As a result, the child-Libra or listens to his parents, or finds a role model among peers – unfortunately, not always the best example.

The sooner parents begin to encourage any manifestation autonomy and independence of judgment of a child born under this sign, the better. Of course, one should not condone wrong actions and wrong actions, but to give the child the opportunity to think things through and come to your own opinion, absolutely necessary.

Children-Scales quickly adopt habits of adults who willingly take part in all the Affairs of your elders. However, very often they overestimate their strength, are taken for impossible things, and then suffer from fatigue, which usually affects emotional state. Children-Libra is prone to deep feelings, reflections on unpleasant topics the endless parsing of a grudge. Well, if the parents of the baby are able to get pleasure from life – and then the child will tend to have more positive attitude towards everything.

In childhood Scales are often painful – colds, allergies and other ailments do not pass them by. Parents should pay special attention to the hardening of the kids, to accustom them to regular exercise and proper nutrition.

Another characteristic feature of the scale-children lies in their very high sensitivity; these kids are sensitive to sudden and loud noises, don't like screaming colors, feel extremely uncomfortable in the clothing of "scratchy" fabrics. As a kind of compensation the nature generously gives these kids musical, artistic or artistic abilities; the question is to find talents to good use.</p><hr><br>According to the materials mail.ru
