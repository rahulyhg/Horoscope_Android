</p><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL PORTRAIT</strong><p>

Aquarius refers to the number of active characters, and to the greatest extent it relates to psychic organization: people born in this period, easily excitable, they often lose self-control, for a long time to worry over the smallest incidents. To the real activities of Aquarius, though with the strongest hidden energy, can only encourage critical circumstances - it then shows his inner strength, the ability to defend yourself and to protect the interests of others.

Aquarians love to be around people, they instantly appear friends and acquaintances, but in the soul Aquarius always feels lonely. His interest in others, and to life in General, is more scientific and theoretical in nature; to learn new things is much more interesting than to make efforts to change the situation.

Sensitive nature of Aquarius makes them touchy, forgiving people of this sign can not be called: they seem to don't forget. Except, perhaps, to its own promises.

Things Aquarians seem devoid of logic, but do not trust this impression. Just usually Aquarius has far more information than those who surrounds it, and, therefore, forced to consider the factors about others do not even know. Unfortunately, Aquarius rarely uses his knowledge: he ponders, but is in no hurry to act.

We also add that Aquarians tend to charity; they are willing to do something for someone else than for yourself, and dispose of other people's money better than their own.

</p><strong>THE ELEMENT OF THE SIGN</strong><p>

Aquarius is an Air sign, and this may explain the breadth of their nature and ability to penetrate simultaneously in many areas.

The air of Aquarius is all atmospheric layers at once; the people of this sign may be interested as something earthly, and very sublime.
Open for spring wind window, the thin air of the mountains, with great speed rushing planes – all of this has a place in the world of Aquarius, but it's not enough. In the midst of any tornado Aquarius is able to maintain absolute calm, but in a stuffy, albeit a cosy room will be pining. The need to breathe causes of Aquarius to avoid close, even passionate embrace.

</p><strong>HEALTH</strong><p>

Aquarians are not the buxom buddies; from nature with very little power, these people spend their extremely generous, so at a very young age they will learn what is chronic fatigue, insomnia, fatigue. Aquarians need to protect the nervous system, but they don't like to admit their weaknesses, and suffer even more.

Many of them have serious vision problems, and diseases of the circulatory system. Older Aquarius often has pain in the legs, varicose veins, blockage of blood vessels.

In order to maintain health, Aquarians do not need so much - not to worry over trifles, sleep well, move more and exercise. But even such simple rules people can follow long: inspired by something new, they are able to forget about healthy lifestyles, in addition, tend to try on itself controversial, even risky methods of treatment.

Aquarians are rarely concerned about proper nutrition, so they have stomach problems. This is often exacerbated by diets that Aquarians do not consider it necessary to discuss with doctors. By the way, people of this sign tend to feel wary doctors. Even preventive visit to dentist they prefer to postpone for another year or two and if they have a concern, are more likely to worry and suffer than allow specialists to diagnose myself and prescribe treatment.


</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>

Aquarius – bright and extraordinary personality, capable of many things and know no barriers. Their happiness in his personal life often prevents the impression of alienation and detachment, which they make on others is false and devoid of reason experience! A lot of difficulties due to the fact that few people are able to understand Aquarius. But the one who did not remain indifferent to the representative of the sign. 

Perhaps one of the most serious problems for you is to find harmony between willingness to change and desire to find your own path and desire to maintain tradition, to avoid anything that may to provoke conflicts with others. Even in the most intimate relationship Aquarius tends to be a little elusive, to keep secret some of their experiences, to have a "personal territory", sometimes quite extensive. It's hard to balance two equally strong desires to have a partner and to be free; those who believe that this could be achieved, usually do not suspect that something was sacrificed.

Almost without being influenced from the outside, Aquarians find it possible to impose on others their own opinion, but do it tactfully and gently. Some representatives of this sign use methods of psychological manipulation, without even noticing it, and not a little offended when they put on clean water. Usually you look for a partner that can be trusted in all things; harmony in the relationship also implies that the chosen one will be able to trust you – forget about it!

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. I feel like a prisoner(tsei) in a romantic relationship<br>

Freedom refers to the number of things for Aquarius is extremely important, and anything that might be regarded as an attack on her, the representatives of this sign prefer to avoid. However, a romantic relationship, usually require, in varying degrees, rejection of independence. In situations when you have to take into account the interests, desires and expectations of the partner, Aquarians often feel depressed, really unhappy, but recognize that to do without it is impossible.

The situation becomes critical when romantic ties of Union are submitted to your imagination system restrictions that do not bring joy – and this should be avoided. Pay attention to those positive emotions that bring you the relationship, the positive emotions that you feel from intercourse with a partner. Of course, some "personal space" is desirable to maintain, otherwise you are unlikely to feel comfortable. However, it can be a cause for resentment and mutual claims, if a partner wants to cross the border, which does not even suspect. Your task is to explain to your partner that you are not railing against him and hide something that can cause damage to your relations, as well as the fact that the aforementioned "space" is not a sign of your coldness. Be honest and open with those you care about; if your feelings are mutual, you will manage that for many is impossible: to feel and be loved, and free.

<br>2. We cannot find a common language<br>

Aquarians are considered excellent speakers, but, alas, the eloquence remains only a shadow, when they talk about their feelings. Indeed, when it comes to emotions and feelings, there is a barrier to overcome which is very difficult. Accustomed easy to tell others your thoughts, you find yourself at a dead end, close if the person cannot understand you perfectly, because to a deeper discussion of the problem you yourself are not psychologically ready. 

If you strive for harmony in relationships, learn to talk about feelings that you are experiencing, and to show them otherwise. Admit that you are not rarely resorted to the mask of coldness and prudence, and then suffered due to the fact that no one can comprehend the depth of your feelings? Yes, in order to be understood by the partner and to understand it will have to cease to be a "man of mystery" at least temporarily – without openness, and openness on a deep emotional level constructive dialogue in a romantic relationship impossible.

Another aspect of this problem is that Aquarians tend to talk a lot – it can create a lot of difficulties, if your partner does not have the ability to patiently listen and to isolate necessary and important information. If you are dealing with such a person, be prepared to separate the important from the unimportant, not waiting until he will do it for you, not hiding their problems for the beautiful words and complex logical constructions. Simplicity and brevity will contribute not only to the fact that your partner will understand you better – it is possible that they will give you a chance to understand myself better.

<br>3. We too often quarrel<br>

Aquarius, nobody else is going to seem like a tyrant, actually often ensured that everything was done in accordance with his wishes. The paradox is that the representative of this sign may not be happy with a man who comes to meet all his whims, and intuitively know it in the beginning of a relationship. You choose a strong partner, able to resist you – and the struggle begins, not always noticeable to others may not be taking the form of conflicts and quarrels, but certainly cause discomfort to both. Things are heating up, and any little thing can turn into a bomb undermining the very Foundation of the relationship. At first it seems that to make up after a fight is not too difficult, but soon it turns out that in a novel there are more and more pitfalls, and Aquarius – not too big fans of the difficulties.

In order to avoid quarrels, try to be gentle, not only externally but also internally and don't lock your heart on lock, if not everything goes as we would like. Try to persuade the partner to engage in constructive dialogue, don't punish him for his behavior the expression of points of view different from yours. Resenting, otmuchivanie, putting ultimatums and agreeing to a compromise only after negotiations ceased to be peaceful and friendly, you create a negative background for the further development of relations. Of course, it would be ridiculous to assume responsibility for all differences; but it's worse to wait endless concessions and indulging their whims from a partner, in which you see a person, not a toy.

<br>4. I can't find a suitable partner<br>

Such complaint, heard from the lips of Aquarius can seem quite strange, since the representatives of this sign usually have a wide circle of friends and not deprived of the attention of interested persons. However, not so often it comes to romantic relationships, because to fall in love, the Aquarius is not so easy: he clearly sees the flaws of the people who surround him, and even secretly suspects that by opening your heart to strong feelings, will become vulnerable and lose independence. 

That is why individuals who have the Aquarius unambiguous signs of attention may seem to him partners absolutely wrong, and even the idea to go on a date with another fan seem strange. Try to be a little less sensible, because not every person you cute, to see the enemy and the foe. 

On the other hand, prior to the beginning of a really serious relationship, then you better know the person you choose. Oddly enough, in matters of the heart intuition sometimes you fail, and you can make a choice strange, and even ridiculous, guided by first impressions, or the advice of friends, or just desire to spend time withsomebody".

Very high representatives of your sign is likely to meet his fate among like-minded people who share your Hobbies and preferences. So do not refuse to discuss their interests, attending special events, clubs and forums – at least, the chosen one will not encroach on your hobby!

<br>5. He refers me lightly<br>

Aquarius requires much from a partner, but a never burns bridges. Preferring to remain elusive and misunderstood, he, however, wants to be important, indispensable for his partner, and gets very upset if he understands that it is not. A serious romantic relationship with Aquarius't people wise who knows life and is able to accept others as they are without trying to fix. But in this case with regard to possible imbalance. So, with excellent sense of humor, Aquarians are not too fond of, when joking over them; being by nature a tainted natures, they are waiting on your partner of absolute permanence. Note also that you extravagant, independent and prone to dramatic antics. Try to be more practical and predictable, if you feel Mature enough for business relations and creating a family.

Remember that a serious relationship requires and long – term liabilities-those obligations that you would normally try to avoid. Your partner will treat you the more serious, the more obvious it will be for your willingness to take responsibility not only for their own actions, but also for the development of relations. Discussing with your loved one their plans for the future and interested in his opinion about them, you will give your partner to understand that his opinion of you care – and, in turn, will be able to understand the importance of your role in his life.

Knowing that by nature endowed with a developed intuition, Aquarians tend to lose faith in her when it comes to romantic relationships. Learn to trust your feelings and share them, become more open for the elect. Sometimes even the closest people feel that your heart is closed for them, and that is what causes disharmony. The perfect partner for you will be the one who can to be not only a lover but also a friend – is it possible to be friends with a person incomprehensible and inaccessible?

<br>6. I fear the cessation of our relationship<br>

Paradoxical it may seem, the fact that Aquarians are independent and freedom-loving, sometimes prisoners are not acceptable relations, a victim of manipulation of the partner, in a word, feel unhappy, but don't try to change anything. Does this mean that Aquarius is afraid of loneliness? Not quite true; in fact, he is afraid to be alone with their feelings and experiences, which can be so strong that to cope with them will not succeed.

Do you give others the impression of a man that can control his emotions, and I am trying to avoid strong stress that these emotions can be released. A breakup with a partner, even if the relationship was not harmonious, it is presented to you on such situation. Giving your feelings a little more freedom even in normal, everyday behavior, you will be able to psychologically prepare yourself to take decisive action, to better understand their own emotional experiences.

In a romantic relationship prudence and composure sometimes not superfluous, but they will be as useful as intuition and attention to their own aspirations and desires.

<br>7. I'm not ready to create the family, and my partner insists on it<br>

Aquarius may not feel the needs in the marriage relationship, even being a man of Mature age. It's not so much that he is afraid to take responsibility is a much more serious danger he represented a loss of independence and freedom, and also the people who will control his actions. Try to analyze their own beliefs about marriage – whether it seems to you, at least partly, a trap from which it will be not so easy to get out? Most Aquarians tend to prefer non-traditional unions, for example, to live separately from loved one, or always have a place where you can be alone, to remain faithful to the "bachelor" type of behavior, finally, not to make the relationship official, and not to have a common property. If your partner is ready for it, the difficulties can be overcome, but usually this situation is good for only one member of a pair – you.

Ironically, for all its independence, Aquarius has another important quality is the desire for love and emotional harmony, although sometimes doesn't feel he needs in the family. To yield to the persuasion of a partner, without feeling the need for creating marriage, of course, not worth it. However, to dispel their gloomy illusions concerning family life, you are quite capable. Don't worry that a family will prevent you to realize their aspirations and achieve their goals; although we have to admit that such an act will require determination and practicality. 

Don't let the partner be manipulated, but, if your goals and plans for the future at least to some extent coincide, look for compromises that will keep the relationship and to achieve harmony in them.

</p><strong>CAREER AND PROFESSION</strong><p>

Aquarians often dream of a career as an entrepreneur, but in fact it is more profitable to remain employed: in this case they relate to business more responsibly and achieve the best results.

Generally, to be successful in the business field Aquarius't have the willpower to cope with them, and thick-thick skin which would protect their delicate soul from the influence of the outside world. In addition, people born under this sign, are rarely even calculated risks and too late use your chance. So there is nothing surprising in the fact that rich people from Aquarius rarely succeed.

But among them quite a lot of famous people, literature and art give them a lot more than a business opportunity.

Aquarians can succeed in areas requiring contact with people - journalism, sociology, teaching activities, but it will never be given wholeheartedly. They need the opportunity from time to time to be alone with him, so Aquarians who have chosen a public profession, often give myself a long vacation, who prefer to hold in lonely places.

From Aquarius psychologists are fine and good therapists, consultants on various issues, guides and travel agents. In addition, among them many scientists, often affecting the breadth of his horizons.

</p><strong>SEXUALITY SIGN</strong><p>

Loving Aquarius is humanistic, not sexual-erotic nature. Before their love for humanity pales even the most vivid novel.
Partners Aquarians are chosen primarily among those who are indifferent. Power to conquer an impregnable fortress are even the most powerless members of this sign. Easy prey Aquarius does not interest, but they will show the wonders of charisma and demonstrate a variety of sexual talents, to keep aloof or elusive partner.

Aquarians usually impress people sexually active, but intimate sphere of life where they are interested in more from a theoretical than from a practical point of view. A romance with an Aquarius is more intellectual than physical, and is remembered long confidential talks, not bright moments of passion.

The behavior of Aquarius is extremely difficult to judge if he was satisfied his partner; often he himself doesn't know. People of this sign should not say that in love they are superior to others; they have confidence in their originality and uniqueness, and that it is considered especially valuable.

Aquarians appreciate the beauty and could refer to a beloved on his foreign disadvantages, although it may seem tactless. On the other hand, they tend to accept your partner the way he is, and is unlikely to make him change the appearance in favor of their own ideas.

</p><strong>MARRIAGE AND COMPATIBILITY</strong><p>

Aquarians are endowed with great mental powers and the ability to experience a very strong love, although not usually show. Moreover, they prefer to stay away from the man, who captured their heart, fearing to be deceived and to lose liberty. Aquarius can burn with passion, while maintaining external indifference that even the most perspicacious not be called a put-on.

Aquarians are trying as much as possible to avoid marriage or stable Union. They do not tolerate jealousy and jealous themselves; Aquarius won't hold a partner if he wants to leave, though, and will try to keep friendly with himrelationship.
The thirst for perfect, flawless novel pursues the Aquarius throughout life. But even such a relationship it will break, if you realize that they occupy it in its entirety. As much as neither was in love with Aquarius, he needs time to be alone, but also for learning about the world, which may not be concluded in one, even the most desirable man.

Partner with a Aquarius looking for the mind, independence of thought, openness and kindness. Besides, being tactless, stressed they require careful attitude to his own person.

Aquarians rarely change, at least physically. But they will long remember first love, do not lose ties with former lovers, and love to dream about how you could develop a relationship.

The nature of Aquarius allows him to see the good traits in people of all signs, but the vanity of a Lion and the uncertainty of the Weights will cause him the ironic attitude is disastrous for a love Union.

Aquarius will be able to see the thin sensitive soul behind the shell of Cancer, to assess the elevation of the aspirations of the virgin.
The Union of two Aquarians often characterized by a feeling of extraordinary power and depth.

</p><strong>CULINARY PREFERENCES</strong><p>

Aquarius, which, in principle, healthy vegetarian diet, can easily give up meat, but it is very difficult to deprive yourself of chips, cookies, soft drinks and French fries. On the other hand, to fresh vegetables and fruits Aquarians generally indifferent, although I understand their favour.
Aquarians useful apples and pomegranates, but to include them in a constant diet of these people are not in a hurry, as well, and buckwheat with rice that would be there more often.

Aquarians hard to stick to three meals a day, so they often engage in a "snacking". This would have been okay if Aquarians are chosen to satisfy the hunger for something other than smoked sausages, breads and sweets.

</p><strong>CHILDREN'S HOROSCOPE</strong><p>

Children-Aquarians are very restless, capricious and unpredictable. They do not get tired to surprise parents, and sometimes shocking, loving relatives their incomprehensible actions. Children born under this sign are gifted with special abilities, but to reveal the nature of their talent is very difficult. The fact that Aquarians sometimes do not realize what they have "is the soul". Too important role in their life plays a certain elusive inspiration, which then suggests how to drive the brush across the paper to make it a masterpiece, it helps to find the right solution to a complex mathematicaltask.

Aquarius - great inventors; absolutely extraordinary ideas visit them several times a day. The problem, as you might guess, occurs at the implementation stage. First, Aquarians are not very diligent, and secondly-they overestimate their abilities, third – ignore any advice that they do not like. Very rarely among Aquarius children are able to reason logically; more often they are guided by intuition or by some "common sense" - the latter, with a lack of life experience, does not lead to anything good.

Aquarians are very rarely obedient, they prefer to always get their way, even if stuffed with lump and find ourselves in difficult situations. However, parents can "negotiate" with the child-Aquarius, if you will respect his wishes – compromises representatives of this sign are quite easy.

Aquarians are very restless, impressionable, shy. Parents should ensure that the child lived in a supportive, emotionally comfortable environment. If adults often quarrel, find out the relationship, saying hurtful words, little Aquarius may even get sick.

Children born under this sign rarely can boast of hard work and diligence; and if they achieve academic success, mainly due to unexpected "insights", as well as the ability to solve non-standard tasks. Relationships with teachers will emerge quite hard, because Aquarians any observation tend to regard as an attack on their rights, who are ready to defend with all means available.</p><hr><br>According to the materials mail.ru
