</p><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL PORTRAIT</strong><p>


Capricorns have enough energy, but steering them sign still belongs to the passive, which explains inherent to those born under it the people more likely to save than spend in attempts to gain more. This applies not only to money and material goods, but also emotions.

Capricorns will not argue, defending their opinion, but stay with it and be diligent to gather evidence of self-righteousness. They do not fit into the conflict, but will try to capitalize on his permission. Capricorns rarely unsettling fail - they go to the planned purpose, and sometimes, if the interest already lost, just by inertia.

Capricorns are very reserved and unemotionally, while passion is totally alien to them. Just all the experiences born under this sign people hiding really deep and trusts only the closest people.

They believe in their own strength, but can't give the impression that the circumstances are invariably formed against them, and generally consider yourself unlucky.

An innate sense of responsibility makes Capricorns take care of the weaker. However, Capricorns rarely do it selflessly: usually they expect gratitude, but if not get it - once again convinced of the imperfection of the world.


</p><strong>THE ELEMENT OF THE SIGN</strong><p>


Capricorn – the sign of the Earth, which explains the practicality and reasonableness of its speakers.

The ground is possible to see, to feel, to weigh; it is unlikely that someone can try it in reality. Such categories and think Capricorns – illusions, abstract reasoning, imaginary ideals are alien to them. People born under this sign are attracted by their prudence dreamers often turn for advice, but rarely follow it: beliefs Capricorn prosaic, values – material.

The Earth is extremely rich, but to get to the treasure is not easy. Dignity Capricorns are hidden from outsiders views, but the interested seeker opens a real treasure: a faithful friend, an honest partner, responsible officer or sensible head, a faithful lover. The most important in my life things Capricorns make imperceptibly, to the highest peaks of life they rise slowly.

Capricorns know how to properly dispose of what they have, appreciate the stability in work and family.


</p><strong>HEALTH</strong><p>

The mistake is to say that Capricorns in poor health, but they often get sick; cold and damp are the main enemies of the people of this sign: the warm rain, the breeze is fraught for them not only colds, but also more serious consequences.
Despising care about their appearance and devoting himself to the work, Capricorn shun such "frivolous" things like massage, diet, exercise. However, doctors, they also visit infrequently. Meanwhile, just for Capricorn is especially important to keep the skin clean and toned muscles, to ensure that the power was varied.

"Weak point"  Capricorns are the skin (excessive sensitivity, enlarged pores, acne), teeth and bones (excess calcium leads to the development of Tartar, growth cones and vypuklosti), stomach. But special attention should be paid on the nervous system. Emotions that restraint and external equanimity do not give out responsible for fatigue, allergies, digestive disorders and headaches Capricorn.

Capricorns should prescribe levity and carelessness in moderation, but because the tablet does not release, you should use other means. Active lifestyle, clean air, sunlight, and healthy sleep will help Capricorn to feel not only healthy, but happy.

</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>

Capricorns, no less than other signs of the Zodiac, strive for harmony and happiness in your personal life, but guess this is sometimes difficult. Representatives of this sign are conservative and not prone to change, which is why they sometimes become hostages relations, exhausted, anxious cooling partner, but don't make a decisive move, and Frank showdown prefer to avoid. 

Feeling that the relations are not as we would like, Capricorn can take in solving minor problems – for example related to the organization of everyday life, or focus on professional activities, hoping that everything will settle by itself. Sometimes representatives of this sign believe that not endowed with the qualities necessary for happiness in his personal life, though actually it is not so. 

Many Capricorns bothers to build a harmonious relationship, the fact that they too have a clear idea of what would like to see a love Union, and the partner becomes a hostage of these representations. Interfere with can and incorrectly prioritized and some pessimism, characteristic for the representatives of this sign. Useful in the difficult task of finding personal happiness is the ability to find a reasonable balance between professional and personal life; it would also be a good idea to learn to relax and entertain, not anchor himself for inaction and laziness. Finally, another feature that prevents to reach an understanding with your loved one, may be excessive self-discipline that allows you to not show feelings and emotions when necessary.

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. I can't find a suitable partner<br>

Capricorns are intelligibility, which sometimes exceeds all reasonable limits. To your potential partner, they have a lot of high demands, including socio-financial nature. We are not talking about blindly lower the bar and settle for the attention of someone to pay attention to you; however, and waiting for Prince charming or perfect in all respects beauties can hardly be called a constructive position.

In his quest to create the perfect Union Capricorns tend to reject everyone who doesn't fit in they have created a coherent system, and sometimes ignore even the voice of your own heart, in the end content with a marriage of convenience or a Union in which there is stability, but no really deep feelings. If you believe that to enter into a romantic relationship is only with those who will contribute to your rise up the career and social ladder, tune in to the fact that the harmony in the pair will be very relative.

If first you put love, remember that you have a heart and listen to his voice. Sometimes intuition can be trusted more than logic, and that you accept the delusion caused love, turns out to be true! You should not be surprised or upset if gentle are your feelings about the person that is difficult to get along, the identity of the original and even extravagant: sometimes love makes it possible (and happy!) such unions that logic seem incredible.

Be attentive to others, give yourself the opportunity to get to know people, and you will see that there are many of those to whom you can experience sincere sympathy. Trusting your own feelings, you will discover a lot of new possibilities, new ways to happiness.

<br>2. He (she) is unfair to me<br>

Even being in love, Capricorns do not lose their judgment and common sense and sense of justice that they have very acute. The reason that you get the feeling of unfair treatment by a partner, may be its excessive demands, criticism in your address, unwillingness to consider your interests or the failure properly to appreciate the efforts that you put to development of the relations.

If your partner is human not alien to logic and able to rationally evaluate their own behavior, you can openly present their claims, supported them examples. However, remember that in your address might sound somewhat unpleasant statements. Capricorns tend to selfishness, and sometimes they put their own interests first, without even noticing it; moreover, they often underestimate the sacrifices made by the partner. You may feel that the concessions of your choice – a small thing, unlike your own. However, putting yourself in the place of the partner and trying to share his view on what is happening, you will understand that in this case, the accusations of injustice unreasonable. If in a relationship you clearly relegated to a secondary role, and attempts change that lead to nothing, have to take more serious steps. In any case, the issue of "unfairness" in the relationship should try to discuss and resolve as early as possible, yet have not accumulated resentment has not disappeared, the desire to find common ground with a partner.

If your choice fell on the man, actions which are dictated largely by the feelings and momentary gusts to seek partnerships will be difficult. In this case you risk to be in the role of an indulgent parent, who from time to time puts up with all the whimsical antics of Chad. When the bowl your patience overflows, to change the situation will be too late. To prevent this, try to gently correct the behavior of the elect, in a sensitive, but not indulging all his wishes, tactfully, pay attention to the situation that you are unhappy, but avoid insults: conflicts and scandals isn't your thing. The main thing is not to accept the situation that causes you discomfort, only because he is afraid to offend dear man; you are wise and will certainly find a solution acceptable to both parties, if not let the situation take its course. 

<br>3. Our relationship is stable, but there is no real harmony<br>

Many Capricorns fall into the trap that put themselves in order to avoid disappointment and turmoil, they choose the person with whom the relationship will be predictable and will not bring surprises. In other words, trying to rid yourself of negative emotions, you are leaving the Fort and pleasant experiences to throw up. Most often do those who have already experienced a whirlwind romance that ended in a painful breakup; when choosing a new partner, they prefer the person who never makes them strong feelings, but quite nice, unpretentious and ready compromise. However, Capricorns are often not even aware how strong their temperament and how important emotions for them, and therefore are surprised, if soon begin to feel the joy of stability and boredom.

An important role can play and your concentration on financial security. Solving financial problems, you risk to forget about how important intimacy. Special challenges it can bring to those whose partner is a man romantic, focused largely on the harmony of feelings than on productive partnerships. 

Keep in mind, the harmony in the relationship often comes to those who are in harmony with yourself. Try to reduce the level of internal stress, allow yourself to relax and become a little less self-critical and serious. It is also worth to add that some Capricorns are very low estimate of the importance of the sexual component of a romantic relationship that may be the cause as their own discontent with the Union and discomfort partner.

<br>4. I don't feel loved (loved)<br>

The problem with many Capricorns is that they misjudge their emotional needs and just can't give loved ones to understand what is actually expected of them.

Many representatives of this sign impress people cold and calculated, not prone to romance and the manifestation of tenderness; acts committed under the influence of emotions, they see as weakness. Is it any wonder that their partners quickly assimilate the proposed course of action and tend not to show their feelings? Perhaps your partner does not even know that you suffer from lack of attention or warmth. Sometimes Capricorns themselves suffering from discomfort in the relationship, do not realize how important the expression of feelings on both sides.

Those who seeks true intimacy in the relationship, it is necessary to ease somewhat, to stop being "an impregnable fortress" in the eyes of the partner, allow your feelings to grow and flourish – the person you love, will not remain indifferent to it. 

<br>5. Partner is waiting too much for me<br>

Capricorns never give promises, not sure if that will be able to perform them, and in regard to romantic relationships, I try to keep this risk to a minimum. In addition, representatives of this sign do not like to be the object of other people's manipulations and become stubborn when they feel that they are moved to one or another step. It is this stubbornness and sometimes impede the recognition that the demands of your partner is not too high and, in addition, quite fair.

We have to admit that Capricorns tend to conservatism. Protecting the lifestyle that had become habitual, the representatives of this sign would prefer to stay away from anything that promises change, and therefore many partners prefer to say no.

If your partner is dear to you, be ready to give up and meet his expectations – he probably does the same for you. If you for some reason are not ready to meet the wishes of the partner, try to explain the reasons for its decision, to look for a compromise or offer compensation. In this situation, the error will accumulate discontent and to avoid discussion of the problem. In addition, if the requirements of the partner you seem to be excessive, arbitrary or unreasonable, do not assume that you are not right for each other and continuing the relationship impossible. At first listen to the opposite side – there is a chance that you just do not absolutely correctly interpret the behavior of his chosen.

Your strengths – the ability to think straight and keep cool in any situation. Do not assume that a romantic relationship is not a suitable field for the display of intellectual abilities; it is in your power to solve the problems, if you are ready to initiate dialogue, to take into account the interests of the partner and, after considering the situation, to propose a compromise solution.

<br>6. He is too frivolous(th)<br>

In a romantic relationship Capricorn often assumes the role of "parent" - that is, more wise, responsible, prudent and cautious partner. It deals with the practical issues and domestic problems, makes plans for the future, considering different scenarios. Sometimes it seems the only possible variant, sometimes entertaining and sometimes extremely tedious occupation. It is in these moments you expect your partner to behave as an equal partner, and are disappointed when this does not happen.

The mistake many Capricorns connected with the desire to take full responsibility for what is happening, not allowing the partner to make their own decisions, even if he wants it. That is why at some point you face a situation, when to solve problems-handedly: your partner used to the fact that you do so, and not in a hurry to participate in the process. 

In addition, you should learn to relax and trust your fate – sometimes you can afford to be less pedantic, open and even capricious. Remember that not all actions should be dictated by common sense and by considerations of use, on desire, including your own, should also pay attention. Serious attitude to life, of course, commendable, but the levity in homeopathic doses does not harm anyone else.

<br>7. Our happiness interfere with domestic disputes<br>

Capricorns are extremely serious about everything that concerns the material side of life. It may seem that the representatives of this sign are focused exclusively on financial and domestic issues, which is why they are not always smooth relations with those who have other priorities.

Of course, material wealth and high social position are important, but should we appreciate them more than close relationship? Spare no effort for the sake of the family you run the risk of being in the "workhorse", and the probability that loved ones won't appreciate your deeds.

Household differences can be overcome – that's what you need to understand that the love boat crashed on the rocks of dirty dishes, cramped apartment or used car. Don't blame someone in that he does not share your aspirations or desires, the probability to cope with difficulties will be higher if you act together, to strive for a common goal. Often you do not even try to negotiate with your partner about how to make life enjoyable for both, pre-setting yourself up for failure. Meanwhile, the situation is rarely catastrophic; respect what makes your partner, and not hesitate to draw his attention to what and what do you personally do. 

Family members are United not only by a joint address domestic and financial difficulties; diversifying your life, decorating it with festivals, memorable events, travel, you will see that many of our everyday problems fade into the background. After all, a man endowed with your enviable intellect, is unlikely to want to immerse your head in the solving of everyday problems, if he has a more pleasant and attractive prospects.

</p><strong>CAREER AND PROFESSION</strong><p>

Being human "earth" sign, many Capricorns achieve professional success in areas such as mining, construction, agriculture. Other research devoid of the spirit, but not the sense of beauty, an unrivaled experts in the field of Antiques. Third, driven by ambition and lust for power, refer to policy or administrative work.
Perseverance, punctuality, responsibility and patience make Capricorn a valuable asset in the eyes of his superiors and colleagues here will see him as a competitor rather than pleasant in all respects friend-colleague. The best results Capricorns achieve when working alone, and plays an important role and a separate office.

Capricorn-the heads are heavy-handed and overly demanding. The most cunning spending the time communicating with subordinates, studying their strengths and weaknesses, then becoming shameless manipulators.

Capricorns are more likely to be a lifetime to envy the fortunate businessmen and indefatigable pioneers than once will be decided on a risky, questionable adventure or rash step. Seeking to preserve the achieved benefits and slowly with them augmentation, if Capricorns and achieve real wealth, only the more Mature and advanced age. This contributes to the fact that the conquering career of Olympus Capricorns usually start later than the other signs.

</p><strong>SEXUALITY SIGN</strong><p>

No matter how sane and sensible Capricorn, they are able for one second to get involved partner bright, careless and even stupid; if the companion people can appreciate the constancy, smooth character, and tradition, that their beloved may be the complete opposite. While Capricorns do not have enough duplicity to have both a spouse and a lover; therefore, some of them tend to marry as late as possible, having gone through several novels, others lose interest in sex life.

In sexual relationships, Capricorns prefer to follow the traditions, and, even if secretly dream about bold experiments, most likely, never admit it and, moreover, do not implement - except that in that case, if you will venture on very short novel. Your partner people can be surprised by endurance rather than ingenuity, but they can not refuse in tenderness.

Short affair with Capricorn can be an interesting except from a sexual point of view: a beautiful courtship, romantic dates, walks under the moon - not their nature. But, knowing this person better, you will be surprised at the depth, strength and subtlety of his feelings. With those Capricorn trust, he is able to forget about hard self-control, be charming, playful and frivolous.

</p><strong>MARRIAGE AND COMPATIBILITY</strong><p>

All adhering to traditions and social norms, Capricorns like to forget about them when it comes to family life. They are not in a hurry to stay on one partner, long and patiently evaluating it from all sides, meticulously looking for flaws. Many Capricorns are generally finding their "half" from a purely practical considerations, evaluating the ability of a partner to make money, run a household and care for children.

Capricorns love smart people, but only those who share their point of view, so a life partner tend to look for like-minded people. People of this sign can be relatively happy in Union with less smart ground, but it is unlikely you will trust him.

Capricorns strive for calm and even romantic relationships, but love the effort life frequently slipping away from under their control. People of this sign are often strongly and unrequited love with someone who can't hold or feel misunderstood and unappreciated, if the object of their passion is rustic.

Marriage Capricorns are with all their inherent seriousness and thoroughness. They often enter into marital unions by calculation or, at least pick someone of his social class. Selecting life partner, Capricorn usually remain faithful to him, but to this point they have behind them is a large enough number of both lungs Hobbies and serious relations.

Capricorn can get along with almost all, but the Scorpion is sure to make him suffer, Gemini - doubt in the future, in Aquarius - worrying about reciprocity of feelings.

Next to their own kind Capricorn will be calm and happy, and the lion let him be proud of the family hearth.

Another good partner for Capricorn - rarely losing balance Cells. The elusive Fish can also make a Capricorn happy, but, alas, for a little while. But the gap will cause a heavy blow.

Usually they are easy to study; the majority of those born under this sign children's inherent interest in the exact Sciences, however, in the study of the Humanities they achieve great success.

A certain stubbornness inherent in Capricorn since childhood, with age, it only intensifies. Don't even try to dissuade from something baby-Capricorn: he knows exactly what he wants, and will certainly achieve this, even if I have to act in spite of circumstances and desires of others.
Capricorn – very "home" children. They willingly spend time with your parents, like family celebrations, sincerely happy when they have an opportunity to help someone close to you. About younger brothers and sisters they care not a whit worse than his parents.
