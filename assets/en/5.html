Lions differ lazy power and huge ambition. The desire to reach the top in the whole haunts of lions my whole life, but finds an implementation rather in expectation of benefits from fate than a battle for them; when luck finally finds a Lion, he takes it for granted.

On others the Lions are usually looked down upon, but any criticism overreacting and painful. The fact that the "subjects" of this sign simply can not see around me people who would be worthy to evaluate their actions.

Lions usually have a lot of acquaintances, but not all of them have warm feelings – they too often surround themselves useful (or potentially useful) people, ignoring their personal dignity. Sometimes the Lions themselves regret this kind of Dating, but behave the same. In General, the ability anything to learn from their mistakes, the Lions are not endowed at all: all the victories they explain their own merits, but the cause of the failures we consider the vicissitudes of fate.

People born under the sign of Leo, as a rule, irredeemably materialistic: they estimate only real benefits and are committed to them.

Lions-men's surprisingly easy to get addicted as women, and new ideas. Vanity their truly unlimited, and is exacerbated and perfect inability to healthy competition: too lazy to fight with the enemy, Lions fled from the battlefield. For this reason, the Lviv children often grow up without fathers, who, tired of fighting with the kids for the attention of their mother, go in search of new prey.

Female Lions usually have a lot of fans and tenderly cherish the memory of each of them. They are extremely active, and endowed with a natural gift to do everything: to keep the house perfectly, build a brilliant career, to dominate social life. It is worth noting that ladies born under this sign, are often the spouses of rich people, but the reason is not cold prudence; they just much easier to love a successful and accomplished person than, for example, a poor but promising.

</p><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL PORTRAIT</strong><p>

Leo – a sign of active, and it can not be manifested in the character of people born under it: almost all of them are extroverts, located in the center of public life and yourself which is its "engine". The lions are drawn to strong personalities, but tirelessly watch over the weak, as if trying to share with them his indomitable energy.

Under favorable for Leo the power to be truly great, if fate doesn't favor the "king of beasts", he turns violent, capricious, and totally inactive. On the other hand, being in a situation that requires an immediate response, like a lion losing the sense of fear and tries to go right through where ought to cheat or simply caution.

The lions have a strong will. In their decisions they are independent, but considered not only necessary but also indispensable to influence the behavior of others, because they believe in their own rightness and infallibility.

Incredible emotionality Lviv is usually balanced by self-control, the basis of which is the reluctance to show their emotions in front of those who, in the opinion of a Lion, not worthy to see them.

Considering others inferior to himself in strength of intellect, Lions are often victims of fraud or the betrayal that drove them into the abyss of serious anxiety and depression.


</p><strong>THE ELEMENT OF THE SIGN</strong><p>

The element of Leo Is Fire, and quietly burning in a luxurious fireplace. People of this sign are eager to share their warmth, but in return expect others to support and protect from wind gusts. Fire Lion is burning evenly, not too much, but steadily. It doesn't burn, and warm, although sometimes, admittedly, not enough.

The strength of a Lion is enough to maintain the heat, but the fire will melt ice, though, because Lviv, this task hardly interested. Leo burns for a few, and its energy applies only when counting on noisy, recognized by the society a success.

Among the signs of Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) lion in the most rational use of their resources. In addition, its flame most decorative.

</p><strong>HEALTH</strong><p>

Health lions by nature strong, but take care of it the people of this sign do not consider it necessary. To abandon the party in order to sleep, or opt for a delicious dish healthy - it's absolutely not in the nature of a Lion. Moreover, treating everyone down, Lions, and doctors are rarely considered worthy of their attention and trigger the disease just because we don't know of a specialist who could be trusted with the treatment.

Lions are often the victims of infectious diseases, probably because their social circle is too wide, but the immune system is weak, especially in those rare periods when the lion is no concerned. Being busy with lots to do, albeit useless, the lion becomes as if impervious to disease, but during rest and idleness, he is rapidly losing health.

The most vulnerable point of lions – their heart, ears and head.

It is worth mentioning that the Lions are often the victims of accidents. Their share drop a lot of injuries and fractures. However, this bad luck is offset by the ability to recover rapidly.


</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>

Lions know how to be happy – that they will not take. Personal life of members of this sign are usually very exciting one novel is replaced by another, and the search for the ideal in all respects partner does not stop for a minute. The attractiveness of Lviv in the eyes of others is truly enormous; in many respects it is explained by the fact that the representatives of this sign a lot of attention to their appearance and spare no effort to present himself in the best possible way. Important to you approval, praise and compliments, admiration of those around. A serious problem sometimes is that, overestimating the importance of other people's opinions, the Lions are paying too little attention to their own wishes and aspirations.

But there is the other extreme – not in the least doubting their flawlessness, the Lions become real tyrants in the relationship. Sometimes in order to become truly happy and content with his life, Leo is not only enough drops of modesty Yes a bit of doubt in his own right. They will allow a long time to maintain a relationship, a brilliant beginning – and other lions do not exist.

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. Nobody loves me<br>

The lions need love more than any other Zodiac sign; sometimes they require it as proper and begin to act up, hardly suspecting that adore is not enough. At that, the Lions rarely show their feelings – not least because the nature of their inherent laziness.

Worrying due to the fact that love unloved or inadequate, the lion is actually a lot more suffers from the fact that gets too little admiration and praise. It is important to stop to indulge his ego, to understand that it is not always the one who truly loves you, will compliment your every move.

Not looking for someone who notice your strengths, and one who sees your weaknesses and condescending to them, in this case, you will feel really loved and get rid of the feeling of mental discomfort.

<br>2. He doesn't understand me<br>

Lions are more emotional than other signs of the Zodiac, and it's hard to understand those who have to deal with them. Fleeting Hobbies ever have – each novel you give of your heart, and considerable. However, be prepared for the fact that such a generous gift will not be appreciated. 

The stars have given you a lot of positive qualities, but forgot about one very important thing – the ability to choose a partner whose Outlook would be similar to yours. No one better than lions knows that opposites attract, and so your information about how it ends, really exclusive. In order to reach an understanding with your partner, you have to learn to speak his language, leaving aside emotions and clearly articulating the problem – because in most cases, your partner is more cold-blooded, rational and sensible.

Another important point that cannot be overlooked is your ability to be offended for a long time, sincerely and with taste. Any little thing can turn into a real drama, but will it contribute to the growth of trust and understanding? Hardly. So learn to talk about their problems and take into account the expectation and the priorities of your partner – this will help to achieve harmony and not the whims and unreasonable demands.

<br>3. I love him (her), but I feel that he(a) does not suit me<br>

The problem faced by many Lions. The reason of it is that you are too often guided by aesthetic considerations – including when choosing a partner. Roughly speaking, you love all the beautiful and not think about the fact that attractive appearance can hide not the best character. In addition, it is characteristic of the Lions when choosing a partner is to take into account the questionable criterion of "we make a cute couple, though where it would be wiser to think about whether you will be a happy couple.

Sort out what exactly you mean by saying "I love it" - quite it is likely that the person meets your expectations in one, but totally disappointing in another. If you have an existing emotional attachment is really very deep and to separation you are not ready yet, you should consider whether you are ready to put up with unexpectedly discovered the disadvantages of his choice – perhaps by saying "he is for me", do you mean that he's in no hurry to fulfill your orders – but is it bad? Sometimes you need guidance, and not always it has to be tactful. Or do you feel that your partner is not good enough (smart, rich, perspective) for you? But he certainly has some positive qualities, give him the opportunity to show them. In the end, the pair, which has a lion, has the potential to be outstanding, prosperous, wonderful, bright and very happy, but sometimes you will need to reallocate roles in it.

<br>4. In our relationship there are unsolved problems<br>

Representatives of any other sign of the Zodiac in such a situation would have given up, admitting that the relationship must end. But these are not Lions. If you find a man who loved and appreciated, we hardly parted with it willingly. The lions can stop novels and revive them, to divorce and re-marry the same person, each time hoping that difficulties can be overcome – but only to accept the fact that it is not.

If you don't want to lose his chosen, the choice is not so great: at least acknowledge that problems exist and deserve attention. You will not be able to remove from his path all the carefully laid out on it but rake will probably learn to avoid them, if you are attentive to their partner. Remember that for representatives of your sign happiness in love is often a result of a serious effort and not be lazy to apply them.

<br>5. I can't find a suitable partner<br>

Yes, the Lions it is not easy. Representatives of this sign are blessed with an extraordinary intellect, but sometimes lose the ability to think straight, when it comes to love. 

One of the most common mistakes of lions – the search for the man who would fulfil all their demands and orders, almost not showing initiative; however, finding such a wonderful personality, you realize that you prefer to see your partner in a different – strong, energetic, and able to resist your will. This usually leads to the termination of the relationship, but new ones are no better, because, alas, remains unchanged. Learn from their own experience and not worry about what your partner may be important in pair – it is unlikely you will lose much, if you'll allow your partner from time to time to make important decisions and to lead in the relationship.

In addition, many lions when choosing a partner it is difficult to assess those traits of his character that are not apparent. However, and this is relatively because of the notorious Lions eye usually prefer to protect the pink glasses, once on their way there someone attractive, witty, wealthy, bright – and which is the subject of the dreams of many others. All this is enough to make the lion marked the beginning of a relationship that may be painful for him.

For you achieve personal happiness is inseparable from the ability to understand people. Remember that your emotional needs are very deep and to satisfy them is not always the person who caught your attention for its obvious advantages. You will not find a suitable partner, guided by primitive requirements, but probably will be happy, if you can respect his chosen one, admire him and listen to himopinion.

<br>6. We love each other but fight all the time<br>

It's frustrating, but hardly can be considered an insurmountable problem: if you quarrel with your partner, it means that in your relationship there's a place for discussion as such. Moreover, we can assume that you have already learned to admit their mistakes, but not yet ready to admit it. The primary task in this case is to learn to turn the dispute into a constructive conversation before it turned into a quarrel or scandal. 

For this you will have to spend some time on comprehension of science diplomacy and mutual concessions. You will be happier if you learn to humble their pride, admit that there are weak and helpless, and finally no longer hide that you are a representative of one of the most responsive and capable of love signs of the Zodiac.

<br>7. Our relationship lacks seriousness<br>

Few dare to serious romance with Leo, since the representatives of this sign have not only advantages, but also a very significant drawback – not too good reputation. You - addicting nature and do not consider it necessary to hide it. Is it any wonder that your declarations of love always cause quite skeptical response? Have to learn the seriousness and deed, not words, to prove his devotion.

In addition, the Lions should select the partner's self, not too dependent on them and is able, if necessary, to assume leadership the actions of the pair. It is around such a person you will be ready for a serious relationship – and they don't keep you waiting.

</p><strong>CAREER AND PROFESSION</strong><p>

Whatever place in life did not occupy the lion, he seeks to dominate. Not having sufficient business skills to succeed in business, lion can, I would go to school, because there he will be one of the people forced to listen to his every word. Other popular lions the field is politics and psychiatry. Interestingly, striving for power, the Lions are unlikely to say exactly what they want more than to satisfy their own ambitions or to bring happiness to the afflicted; people really sincerely wish everyone well.

If the lion managed to become a leader enterprise, whether it's a tiny firm or a huge Corporation, he will gladly take over the conduct of negotiations and the search for new partners; planning, cost accounting and routine too boring for him.

The success of Lviv in business can prevent, perhaps, as too frivolous attitude to money and a complete inability to compete. The lion-head, for example, it is extremely difficult to convince to spend money on advertising: he is confident in his own superiority over others, and believes that it is so well known. But on office decoration and corporate events lion will not spare funds, which could find much better use.

</p><strong>SEXUALITY SIGN</strong><p>

Love is extremely important for the lions throughout life. The heart of a Lion just can't be free – it is either busy, or broken, and, as extraverts, these heroes of love front, trust your feelings all in a row.

The lions expect from a life partner softness, tenderness and affection, as well as the full recognition of his headship in the family. Possessing a highly developed instinct of the owner, the people of this sign require from a loved one absolute obedience, and constant underscore of their values of respect and admiration.

Blinded by the desire to dominate, Lions often do recklessly entering into a marriage with a person who in some way "weaker" them, for example, younger, inferior in mental endowments or takes significantly lower social status. Later they regret it, realizing that you are a victim of fraud or fine calculation. In addition, the Lions even in the family feels lonely, if you can't see in your partner as an equal person.

</p><strong>MARRIAGE AND COMPATIBILITY</strong><p>

Longing for love – the second weakness in Lviv after vanity.

Not imagining life without love, Lions usually have during my life many sexual partners, and there are plenty of short, but full novels, and casual relationships are not rare. Break with your loved one Lions usually survive hard, and tend to seek solace in the arms of a new passion.
Leo is jealous, but too lazy to prove their superiority over others, and, if defeated on the love front, inclined to blame it on everyone except themselves. The ideal relationship, according to the Lion, must be constructed as follows: the vending man himself falls into their arms, and then becomes obedient and willing to fulfill every wish of the ruler. Oddly enough, that's exactly what usually happens.

Lions can easily succumb to sexual provocation, and many of them are simply unreadable, in addition, they tend too quickly to end the relationship. Then the Lions'm sorry about this, but to correct their mistakes or just apologize consider below their dignity.

In love, as, indeed, in cases like Lions forget to listen to the voice of reason, so run into trouble, or a really dangerous situation to get out of them which is possible only thanks to the phenomenal luck.

Full of happiness Leo has the adoration, which will not let him nor occupied by only a Aries, nor interested in the issue of all mankind Aquarius, practical Cancer.

But may be harmonious Union with one friend of the same sign. However, in this case, the household chores have to take any third party.

A good partner Leo can be clever virgin, and that she will get in this Union a major role.

To soften selfishness Leo Sagittarius but Capricorn will sincerely admire your partner-the Lion and be happy for him.

</p><strong>CULINARY PREFERENCES</strong><p>

Lions love to eat slowly, at a beautifully set table, enjoying the abundance of delicious dishes. They would be happy to limit your consumption of spicy and fatty foods, but any prohibitions apply to them depressing and plunged into the darkest mood.

The best algorithm of a Lion – it is reasonable to combine delicious with a very useful and delicious food – with a simple and even rude. The most reasonable of them manage snack to replace sweet pastries vegetables or fruits, but in tough times in life and bad days the hand of the Lion and reaches for the chips, cookies or chocolate.

Lions are basically inclined to stout, but to maintain the ideal weight they should choose a sport, not a diet. Sometimes it may be useful starvation, but liking them is not worth it.

</p><strong>CHILDREN'S HOROSCOPE</strong><p>

Characteristic of the Lions "Royal" behavior appears in children born under this sign, from a very tender age. They learn quickly how to manipulate peers and adults, cleverly play on the most sensitive Strokach souls of others. Happy baby-lion infinitely sweet and charming, but if you dare him to deny, soon become unbearable. Before the parents of such a child has a difficult task: on the one hand, to create a comfortable environment in which to develop his talents and inclinations, and to prepare him for life in a world where not all wishes come true by magic.

Virtually all children-Lions learn well and easily, great efforts they make. However, young representatives of this sign are very lazy, which leads to problems. Another side of nature, which is evident when the Lions are in a circle of peers is an enormous thirst for attention. Baby-Leo is ready for everything to feel the most loved, to emphasize their superiority over others. Parents need to pay special attention to the interaction of a lion Cub with the team, as much as to help, to givetips.

Children Lions are very hungry for new experiences, they appreciate every opportunity to find something new. Sorry, have to do with the "entertainment" have parents; the Cubs are more likely to suffer from depression and boredom, than will come up with an interesting occupation.

It is not easy to teach a child the Lion to help parents at home – activities of daily living appear to him to be of little interest. But where requires a creative approach, the Cub will manifest themselves, and even adults impose their will. He willingly participates in the selection of furniture and interior items, table decorations, planning special events. In children-lions usually a lot of Hobbies, mostly those that allow to be seen – sport, dance, choir, theatre.

Important thing parents should teach the child the-Lion – build relationships with other people, to listen to their opinion, to take into account the interests. The nature of lions is not very well developed empathy, but the right education can fix it.

Puberty Lions are experiencing rapidly, can not do business without loves and disappointments. At such moments, the child needs to be tactful support. Try to instill in him confidence and optimism, don't let him embittered, blaming others for their failures – unfortunately, this is typical of the Lions.</p><hr><br>According to the materials mail.ru
