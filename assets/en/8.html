Scorpio may seem very motivated, but this quality is manifested only in the details: to indulge in anything for the sake of a distant prospects he will not.

The attitude of Scorpio to the world largely depends on what he managed to achieve in life: losers usually greedy and selfish, but being at the pinnacle of success tend to benefit the largest possible number of people.

For all his selfishness Scorpions are not devoid of humanity, but it is important to encourage and even to cultivate, because Scorpio is capable of this.

Almost all the people born under this sign have their own distinctive personalities, and no one remains indifferent to them. Over the life of the share Scorpions falls many tests, only strengthen their will and ambition.

</p><strong>THE ELEMENT OF THE SIGN</strong><p>

Scorpio belongs to the Water Trigon and all of its constituent signs (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) is the most rapid, unpredictable, open in expressing power. Scorpio is always a raging torrent, often engulfs everything in its path. Hold it there are no obstacles.
A Scorpio's life is hectic and eventful, like river rafting, full of rapids and waterfalls. Often only to manhood Scorpio starts to understand how to dispose of the hardships they have energy, but until then we choke, it gets bruises from blows about the pitfalls.

Scorpio, in unlike Cancer, little worried about the treasures that are buried at the bottom of the sea, and he will not, like a Fish, searching for the most favorable course. The water Scorpion is always lively, but if the surface suddenly smoothed – guard, replaced the calm will come a severe storm.

</p><strong>HEALTH</strong><p>

If Scorpio was born healthy (and often exactly what happens, on the life force for representatives of this sign nature is not stingy), you can be sure that to resist disease he will be to old age: their body as if endowed with the ability to accumulate health. In addition, Scorpios are usually in good physical shape, enjoy sports and reasonable exercise. However, by middle age they become prone to obesity.
Natural gifts fate compensates for Scorpios their luck, without feeling sorry for them accidents, as well as heavy tests that undermines the nervous system. Scorpio can follow a diet, doing exercises every day and lead pravilnasci lifestyle, but to destroy himself unpleasant thoughts, and sometimes even drugs.

Suffer from Scorpions and heart diseases, which are also aggravated in the most difficult periods of their lives.

Another sore point of all Scorpions - back and legs. Spinal disease and varicose veins really worried about them in middle and old age.

</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>

Scorpions can be infinitely appealing, but the reputation of this sign is not so hot, so many people try to stay away from them. However, those who can understand the Scorpio and appreciate the beauty of his soul, will find in him a good friend, a loving and devoted spouse. 

By a Scorpio seeking happiness in personal life, we need to try to control the dark side of his personality. Relaxed and Groovy Scorpio compelling, dark and unfriendly – terrible.

Of course, the strengths of Scorpio are developed intuition, understanding their goals, sexuality and sensuality, as well as special inner strength. Alas, these great qualities do not guarantee happiness, because in compensation nature has given you pettiness, developed proprietary instincts and a penchant for jealousy, as well as internal uncertainty that prevents you to talk about their fears and desires.

Your romantic life can be difficult. Some members of the sign have a lot to go through before they find harmony in the relationship. However, do not despair – your nature flexible, and by working on ourselves and fully using your strengths, you can become happy.

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. I can't find a suitable partner<br>

Despite all the advantages of Scorpions, many try to stay away from the representatives of this sign, fearing the manifestations of the inherent fervor, and unpredictable change in sentiment. In order to save yourself from disappointments and occasional doomed to failure, relationships, you need to understand their relationships with the surrounding world. Watch how surrounding react to your behavior, and you'll understand that it should be amended in order not to create unnecessary problems.

Scorpios know how to please and endowed with an extraordinary appeal, therefore, to suffer from the lack of attention from the opposite sex to them is not necessary. However, novels Scorpions rarely fail them; too often you find yourself associated with people who should stay away. In order to find happiness in love and harmony with yourself, you need to learn intelligibility. The less attention you pay to the men, the merits of which are questionable, the higher the likelihood of meeting someone with whom the relationship will exceed all expectations.

Many of the actions Scorpions may seem paradoxical and illogical. For example, representatives this sign can start an affair with a man whom hold a very low opinion; to maintain a relationship with him, well seeing all the shortcomings of the elect, and then deep to get over a breakup, which occurred not on their own initiative. The reason for this behavior lies in a subconscious desire to outdo your partner to dominate the pair and thereby protect themselves from possible disappointments. Try to think about the ideas of equality; not just so they arose and not accidentally conquered many people. Respect for the person who shares the joys and hardships of your life, not the last the important factor in the difficult task of finding personal happiness.

<br>2. My partner is only interested in sex<br>

Almost all Scorpions are endowed with high sensitivity and very attractive in personal terms. The flip side of the coin sometimes, alas, is promiscuous. The Scorpion often looking for not only physical but also emotional intimacy, but his chosen simply no way to guess about this.

Before starting the tough job of clarifying the relations and claims, Scorpios want to improve. The primary objective is the search for a balance between their emotional and sexual needs; having found it, you will become more personality harmonious – and therefore more prone to happiness. An important condition is and frankness with a partner, the ability to openly discuss issues that concern you. You shouldn't bury your worries and problems for external levity, jokes or snappy, provoking scandals. Often you have driven by the desire to manipulate the partner, to seek from him what works for you; first, this tactic is rather tedious, and, secondly, correctly requested often gives a good result.

However, even if you for some reason decide to open conversation, edit, what happened with you, will affect the behavior of your partner.

The above-mentioned balancing requirements will be useful and for those who haven't met their mate; these Scorpions will be able to attract people that are configured for a serious relationship and not on a non-binding short-term relationship.

<br>3. I don't trust your partner<br>

Scorpios are jealous, although sometimes claim otherwise, and endowed with a strong possessive instinct. In the most severe cases, those who have to deal with them, become slaves of total control, which is not eluding to anything. Scorpions are afraid of losing someone dear to them, and prefer to limit his freedom, not to create the conditions in which man wouldn't want to develop relationships.

Fuel to the fire to pour the unfortunate experience of a previous relationship. Scorpio, who had been deceived and disappointed, is unlikely to be able to relax, even if cause for alarm this time he does not. Inner turmoil leads to increased tensions, conflicts and quarrels – in short, the problems that you would like to avoid.

In order that the situation has become more comfortable for both, you have to learn to respect the right partner for private space. Do not forget that the lack of full control over his elect in the fact that he who is infinite, is not likely to cause you concern.

Do not forget that the choice of a partner worthy of trust – not an easy task, but binding. If you have connected your life with someone who is inconsistent in his attachment, it is unlikely you can expect loyalty from him and to expect that the relationship will be serious. This also applies to other aspects of behavior. Is it not surprising that the relationship with quirky liar or the fact of whose pernicious inclinations you knew before, will be marred by mistrust?

<br>4. He doesn't understand me<br>

Scorpios, especially the young and not having experience in my personal life, remember that not everyone around them is endowed with a strong and accurate intuition. In other words, your partner sometimes have tight, because you don't give him a hint on where to look for the key to your heart, or what to do to relieve you from suffering.

Scorpions are mostly secretive. Their feelings they rarely Express openly, and even to themselves sometimes are not honest to the end. You need to recognize – and admit to your partner, no matter how difficult it has been that you have weaknesses, and also for addiction that you cannot fight alone. If you need help, feel free to ask about it, instead of to wait, when it will be offered, and resent the fact that the partner is not in a hurry to solve your problems.

Keep in mind that your soul is far from simple to comprehend and it is not given to everyone. Choosing a partner, you tend to take into account his sex appeal and sensuality, but often ignore such important factors as the tendency and the capacity for deep emotional contact. Show more intelligibility and seriousness, not to let relations that are not comfortable for you to captivate themselves into the abyss of self-deception, disappointments and unrealistic expectations.

<br>5. I haunt the mistakes of the past<br>

The Scorpions more than other characters, tend to preserve his memory that should be forgotten. Emotional echoes of a relationship, not brought happiness, bothering them for a long time, not allowing you to open your soul to new affections.

Learn to forgive yourself the mistakes and forget the transgressions that were committed by others. Your wounds will heal faster, if not to irritate them again and again, remembering what a pain you've caused this or that person. Reasoning about self-reflection, you sometimes exaggerate their significance, suggesting that the or that a move would radically change the course of events; in most cases, the reason for the breakup or bad breakup complex, but in order to understand this, you must try to understand the difficult science of objectivity. To correct the past is not always possible and there is no need to pull a sad cargo.

You, like anyone else, it is important to learn how to start a relationship with a clean slate and to treat their development seriously. You are wise and prudent, so take advantage of these gifts of nature for our own benefit.

<br>6. He constantly criticizes me<br>

Scorpios do not like to face a disapproving reaction to their actions and decisions. However, sometimes there are desperate people who are trying to instruct the representatives of this sign to the right path – certainly solely noble motives. 

It is not excluded that the criticism and blame coming from your partner is a protective reaction of the person who feels that you try to manipulate it, to direct his actions. Learn when to get out, to listen to each other's opinions – even if not such on what you bargained for. 

The issue of whether whether to respond to comments, there is no straightforward answer – a lot depends on exactly how awkward relationship. Try to understand what largely committed your partner is to their own comfort or the situation in which both of you will feel happy. The paradox of the Scorpion lies in the fact that the representatives of this sign tend to dominate the relationship, but don't want to deal with a weak partner, and sometimes find themselves in a very unpleasant psychological trap. It is not excluded that the critical comments and other ways by which your partner expresses dissatisfaction with you is nothing but an attempt to take the lead in the relationship, is also a kind of manipulation. 

<br>7. I get tired too quickly from the relationship<br>

Emotions Scorpions too strong to be long and stable. You to a greater extent than other signs of the Zodiac, need a new experience. However, not always in order to get them, you need to break up with a partner and again to go in search of the perfect chosen one: sometimes you just need a little time to rest and relax.

In addition, it is very important to learn how to constructively use their extraordinary powers. Enough of them to make relationships the form that will take; however, in most cases, Scorpions direct your energy in a destructive direction, themselves unaware of this. Some of the representatives of this sign tend to blame myself for that emotion has lost its former sharpness, others shift the responsibility to the partner, and very few seek not to blame, and the way out.

If you are aiming for a serious relationship and not ready to settle for a string of casual relationships, make peace with the fact that the emotional content of the novel will not always be the same. With time you will realize that, even if lost in the brightness is definitely acquired in depth. Take care of relationship in which saved love and compassion for each other – their value is huge, and the ability to exert a harmonizing effect on both partners.

</p><strong>CAREER AND PROFESSION</strong><p>

Scorpions have the gift to influence people, besides brilliantly possess good public speaking techniques, and especially a lot of sales consultants, insurance agents and politicians. But to be content with this they should not: personality Scorpions versatile, they make outstanding philosophers, brilliant artists, brilliant occultists.

In addition, the ability to negotiate even the most capricious and demanding partner turns Scorpions in good peacemakers, able to resolve any conflict.

Successfully implemented Scorpions in medicine, especially in diagnosis. In addition, they are not afraid to resort unconventional methods of treatment and often successful conduct risky operations.

Among Scorpions many inventors, but, alas, few distributors. But there is a sensible fellow artist can bring Scorpio triumph in various knowledge-intensive industries.

</p><strong>SEXUALITY SIGN</strong><p>

Sex life of Scorpio throughout life is very uneven. In early youth they keep chastity and are content with Platonic feelings, but in Mature age usually come with a fair amount of experience, and not always positive.

Scorpions are extremely, even magically, attractive, eager to love and sometimes sexually liberated, so much that it borders on immorality and promiscuity.

But, no matter how high Scorpions are not esteemed of erotic pleasure, ambition still is stronger and in some situations, people of this sign are capable of absolute abstinence if believe that it will be useful from the point of view of career. Interestingly, proposals to organize your life using a intimate connection Scorpios often get and indignantly reject, but sometimes later in secret regret.

Even refusing a full-fledged novels, Scorpions never cease to fascinate and attract new victims. Their charm much from nature, besides honed so that to oppose him is simply impossible. The Scorpions do not take the trouble to choose the most attractive, intelligent or interesting partners: they lavished her charms very generous, which, incidentally, not the best way affects their reputation.

I should add that a short affair with a Scorpio many of its partners are perceived as most significant event of his life: creative and erotic unpredictability of people of this sign strikes to the heart.

</p><strong>MARRIAGE AND COMPATIBILITY</strong><p>

In love Scorpions are very dangerous partners - they cause heartache to others, even without wanting to. Family life Scorpions rarely harmonious, people of this sign or become domestic tyrants, or because of its ability to quickly adapt to the situation of losing the self and suffer from discomfort.
Externally providing handpicked complete freedom, Scorpions secret torture yourself by suspicion and jealousy tormented, and sometimes resolved on such a risky venture like snooping or reading other people's letters. The partner Scorpions require full trust and never forgive him for such pranks.

If Scorpio in the pair is the stronger personality, at first he feels the happiest person in the world, but soon begins to blame the partner for the weakness of nature, and ourselves - for the wrong choice. Genuine joy in the love of the people of this sign are capable of experiencing only man capable of both yield and insist on.

Often Scorpio combines not too happy marriage with a passionate third novel, which is given completely and ignoring the opinions of others. Generally, Scorpions are satisfied with their happiness, despising the traditions and generally accepted standards, because we believe that nobody has the right to judge how they should or should not act.

</p><strong>CULINARY PREFERENCES</strong><p>

Scorpions usually follow a specific food or diet, considering it the best of all available. They give free rein to his good appetite, knowing that, if desired, can easily get rid of extra pounds with the help of exercise.

Scorpions usually drink a lot (and not just alcoholic drinks; by the way, in alcohol consumption they are very careful), although it is not too good. Abundantly consumed liquid it is better to replace juicy fruits and vegetables. Coffee altogether would be worth a ban, but instead of black and red to drink green tea.

People of this sign should not give up meat, especially beef and dairy products.

Scorpions are usually sensitive to smells, and many aromatic spices cause them to have an allergic reaction.

</p><strong>CHILDREN'S HOROSCOPE</strong><p>

Even the smallest Scorpion, a real soldier. The nature of his fighting; assertiveness, stubbornness and courage of the young representative of the sign does not hold. Such a child's parents are in trouble, because he always knows how to insist on concessions is with extreme reluctance (if there is), and any form of older weaknesses begins to build from them the ropes.
Scorpio, like anyone else, need a mentor, a loving, but firm. If a child born under this sign, not to discipline, he will never learn to control emotions, will be dependent on your own changeable mood, some fleeting influences. It is also important to pay attention to the development of the child-Scorpion qualities such as the capacity for empathy, forgiveness, patience and Forbearance to the people. Strong character is definitely an advantage of Scorpions; but without warmth and emotional softness they are unlikely to learn how to interact with others, will not be able to get genuine pleasure from intercourse even with someone they love.

Adults it is important to remember that the Scorpio always has secrets – even quite innocent, baby. Not necessary to interfere in the world of such a child: he absolutely you must have certain speculative "territory", access to which is forbidden to others. Especially adamantly defend their right to privacy Scorpions-Teens. Parents have to go to the trick that, on the one hand, not to hurt the child constant supervision, and to obtain at least some information about his life.

Children Scorpios have a huge stock of vitality and energy; sometimes it seems that they are absolutely tireless. Unfortunately, it often becomes a cause of problems: the representatives of the sign can not cope with their own destructive impulses. The most dangerous adolescence. Scorpios are particularly useful exercise, dancing – they not only allow you to use natural energy for peaceful purposes, but also taught to self-discipline, regular work.

Another important feature of child Scorpions is their extremely strong intuition. If the attitude of parents go South, the child will understand it without words; furthermore, it is easy guesses about other people's secrets and the secrets, thereby gaining power over people.</p><hr><br>According to the materials mail.ru
