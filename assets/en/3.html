</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>


The twins are adorable and know how to be irresistible, hardly anyone would argue with that. They easily tie a Dating service, finding both friends and fans, without making much effort. It would seem, sociability and the ability to easily find common language with people, and developed intuition in all that relates to romantic relationships and emotional attachments, must ensure that the Twins happiness in his personal life, but sometimes the representatives of this sign suffer from loneliness, mental discomfort, the feeling of emptiness. 

The Twins are usually a lot of interests, members of this sign always active and know no boundaries in their pursuit of the new. With them can be difficult to get along with those who are committed to the relationship stable and predictable, and just peaceful</p><p> can in any detail to see the reason for a serious quarrel, and the logic of their reasoning is not accessible. Being good speakers, representatives of this sign seems to be almost speechless, when you have to explain to someone the reasons for his actions, though they usually know what they are doing and why. 

So, the Twin is rarely properly understood his partner, he usually remains a mystery, no matter how long no matter the relationship. In love, the representatives of this sign can be happy and unhappy at the same time, and most importantly, what is required of them is to learn to control their condition because the unfortunate Twin torments himself and others and is a real handful.

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. She(a) doesn't understand me<br>

In each pair, there are times when partners find it difficult to divide the point of view of each other or find common ground. However, the Twins have such periods may occur more often than people of other signs, and to last longer. 

The reason for this is that their feelings you are good not as good as in desires, and therefore cannot explain to others what is happening to you, and look like a man Moody, unstable and unpredictable. Do not spare time for introspection – everything that contributes to a better comprehension of his own nature, and useful for your romantic relations. 

Another difficulty stems from the fact that you are usually more talk than listen to their partner, and often not able to appreciate his advice, following which, could change things for the better. Learn to listen, use and analyze the information received from the elect, these you will significantly make life easier for yourself and him.

It should also say that the Twins are rarely long focused on one thing and often forget about the problem before it is solved. For this reason, the partner may consider you too frivolous and seriously offended by your "non-serious" attitude.

So, study your feelings and convey information about them to your partner, not only listen to yourself and learn to take seriously noteworthy problems.

<br>2. My romantic passion does not turn into a serious relationship<br>

The twins are very attractive and flirt or easy hobby for them the natural state. However, too often, what a vivid, exciting novel does not create a family or just a stable pair, and is replaced by another, equally memorable, but no more "persistent".

First, you need to deal with his attitude to the situation. Often the Twins believe that they have enough light, superficial relationships, not too affecting feelings. However, they are uncomfortable due to the lack of a steady partner, and deep affection. Understand yourself and understand what actually aim, and start to show the feelings that you have: it's possible that the partner of your heart seems to be an impregnable fortress, and that is why after a short siege, he prefers to retire.

The second important point is the unwillingness or inability of the Twins to focus on choosing the right partner. Quite often, finding in his human environment is bright and attractive, you move towards it, losing sight of the fact that he tied the marital knot, or not experience to interest you, or just want to pass the time in your the company, while maintaining their freedom and independence.

<br>3. Relationships start well but quickly disintegrating<br>

Love the Twins or are unusually happy or unhappy, and their condition varies sometimes several per day – that they do not get used. But what to do if you feel happy can less frequent, and problems arise more often? Love relationship Gemini often begin to collapse before achieved more or less serious level.

Nasty little things and misunderstandings multiply like rabbits Fibonacci, if you do not pay attention to them. And the Twins sometimes behave that way – focus on the pleasant aspects of the relationship and lose sight of the points on which need serious work. Can be quite long to maintain the illusion of the "perfect" relationship, rejoicing in their seeming perfection – but the difficulty will still be felt, disrupting what you think is harmony.

Exactly Twins are able to choose absolutely the wrong person to get involved – and not notice that they are dealing with deceivers, manipulator or petty tyrants. Try to be realistic and do not allow yourself to forget about the existing problems. Sometimes relationships "disintegrating" because that just can't exist and are just a figment of your imagination.

<br>4. I love him (her), but I like other people; I find it hard to be faithful to one partner<br>

Not necessarily talking about the change; this situation is only one of the faces of the main problems of the Twins – an inability to focus on one thing. Sometimes you can play the feelings of a few people and break hearts, but it does not bring the main thing – the feeling of happiness.

Gemini seems particularly interesting, enjoyable and easy the initial period of a relationship; it gives them a boost of mental vigor, feeling of fullness of life. Thus, on the one hand there was the desire to have one steady partner, with another – the fear of a serious relationship as something boring. Believe that the development of the novel can be no less exciting than the beginning, of course, if your choice has fallen on a worthy person. 

If you are starting to look for a new partner, not because the elect were deceived your expectations, but because the relations are not as we would like, stop – you can make a difference and save someone dear to you, if you correctly use the powers and abilities that have given you the nature. 

The closer you are to your partner, the more new faces will discover in his character. Remember that the person you love is huge world and explore it endlessly, without ceasing to surprise and delight.

<br>5. I'm not able to choose the right partner<br>

By the number of "unhappy loves and affections that carry more suffering than joy, the Twins are ahead of the other characters. Easy adoring by yourself, they are just as easy and do lose their heads, and then are surprised that the object of desire becomes less and less attractive in their eyes. Usually the Twins annoying excessive, in their opinion, focus partner on the practical issues, it's very high requirements, attempts to control behavior. 

On the other hand, if one Twin falls in love with a man like him, relationships are very bright, but rarely last long, not withstanding the test of life or the small everyday problems.

Remember that you need to approach the choice of a partner very seriously. Learn to analyze the behavior of others and their reaction to certain actions of others – so you insure yourself from irritation and tension in a love relationship. It is not necessary to choose "for experiments" someone who interests you from a romantic point of view – can be observed and for colleagues and friends; learning to understand their own reactions to the behavior of people, you will be able to avoid errors due to the incorrect choicepartner.

<br>6. Cabinfever<br>

Sociable, active, cheerful and energetic Gemini very few people can admit that they are sometimes tormented by the feeling of loneliness, lack of a "soul mate", someone who can be trusted. We have to admit that even a bright, attractive, infinitely cute Twins are sometimes unable to find a mate and suffer from it. It is usually in their environment, there are people (and often more than one) that is special to them interest, but it is unlikely that this is recognized simply because fears of becoming a victim of the deadly irony of the Twins or to answer frankly condescending and because offensive.

Be natural, it is something that you sometimes lack. Feel free to be sad, to ask for help and support, to show their interest. Very often others simply do not realize that you have something wrong, and therefore the first step towards you do not. Remember that in personal relationships, the clarity of the intent of both parties is very important, and to solve problems sometimes it is enough just to Express an interest in this.

<br>7. I'm not sure of the seriousness of our relationship<br>

The twins, without being too serious themselves, often waiting for the seriousness from the partner. For example, they do not attach much importance to official registration of relations, but will be happy if partner will offer to do it. Poking fun at his elect, the Twins still happy for his sincere confessions, and their skepticism when it comes to a romantic relationship, is often put on. 

Your behavior sometimes makes us think that love and romance for you is simply an opportunity to gain momentary pleasure Yes jokes. Habit one day at a time, not looking to the future, and change Hobbies several times a day – those things that may have to refuse if you think that ready for a serious relationship. Try to be for your partner a little more predictable and understandable, explain their actions and do not forget to listen to him.
