Sagittarians throughout life differ in the activity of both the mind and body, so it is usually very harmoniously developed and often remain in a good mood. They appreciate the openness, ease and freedom, and any limitations to perceive pain.

The kindness and sincerity of Riflemen, unfortunately, are balanced by impulsivity, is often excessive. In addition, people can easily go to extremes, profiteering enemies of excessive frankness, that useless struggle for justice. Interestingly, Sagittarians often defend the rights of others than their own; they constantly feel responsibility for others and often plagued them in your care.

Among the Musketeers there are two types of people - noble idealists, seeking to make everyone else happy, resourceful and greedy financiers who seek to gain power at any cost. Last many, not without reason, believes flatterers and snobs, but it is a little worried.

By the way, all the Archers are confident in their own perfection and even the most fair criticism falling on deaf ears, and good advice most coarse reject. But with those who are not trying to influence their behavior, Sagittarians are very cute. They always have a joke or a compliment, a moment to chat and even a vest for bitter tears.

Sagittarius men are talkative and sometimes not inferior in wanting chat to ladies. Rebellious spirit transforms of Sagittarius in the eternal adolescent, who can afford the overt rudeness or hooligan attack, and even getting into fights. It's good that Sagittarians usually come out the winners of the fights; by the way, after the battle, they usually do not spare money to appease the defeated enemy. However, Sagittarians are always generous.

Sagittarius women make great mothers who distinguished for nobility and willingness to sacrifice for the family. They almost never punished children for no reason, not cheating husbands and cheating relatives. The only thing that Sagittarius does not like the wife is running the household. She can make every effort to create comfort, but the result will not satisfy her. However, easy to treat this kind of weakness to a female Sagittarius usually helps her unfailing optimism.

</p><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL PORTRAIT</strong><p>

Sagittarius belongs to the active (male) characters and it is hard not to notice. Sagittarius, be it a strategy or a modest performer, always active to restlessness, besides it is easy to decide on a desperate act, but because of the innate fearlessness.
The liveliness Riflemen is, perhaps, only one weakness - the people of this sign are able to engage in only one case, but concentrate on it fully. To solve several tasks at the same time they not only want, but simply can't. I should add that Sagittarians sometimes act too quickly, without having time to think about their actions and to evaluate consequences to which they may lead.

In addition, Sagittarius must believe in what he is doing. He is not guided by generally accepted standards or the attractive prospects, preferring to follow their own inclinations and ideas. The latter, incidentally, non-permanent: Sagittarians are suddenly able to make decisions or to change their point of view on the opposite.

Caution is inherent in many of Riflemen, don't confuse cowardice: it is among men of this sign is particularly high number of representatives of hazardous occupations and fans of extreme sports. Sagittarians are endowed natural gift that helps them avoid injury in risky situations.

Fearing boredom, Sagittarians are not afraid to change my life, would be glad to do it as often as possible, if not to distract from this dream of a happy future and global justice.

</p><strong>THE ELEMENT OF THE SIGN</strong><p>

Sagittarius belongs to the Trigon of Fire. His flames steadily and strongly, and the wind only gets brighter, but not scatters around him sparks and does not cover a large area.

And all the people of the Fire, Sagittarians love all kinds of adventures, but don't throw them headlong, unlike the Rams, and don't daydream instead of action than often err Lions.

Perhaps of all his characters in trine Sagittarius is in the best position – his Fire is strong enough, but at the same time, easy to control. Sagittarians do not burn in the flames of their passions, as Aries, but not are content, like Lions, passive contemplation. Their Fire burns evenly and brightly, giving the necessary energy to move forward.

</p><strong>HEALTH</strong><p>

Archers in General are not very painful, the most serious of their enemies are moisture and cold. Sagittarians catch colds easily, and it's rarely limited to just a runny nose and cough, turning serious diseases of the lungs and throat. Life is particularly hard for smokers Sagittarius, because they tend to indulge their weaknesses and never giving up cigarettes even during illness.

Suffer Archers and rheumatism, which is often a consequence of their habit easy to dress up and spend a lot of time outdoors. No better and those who do sedentary work - they are pains in the shoulders andback.

Generally, in order to be healthy, Sagittarians need the help of a calm, reasonable person who will look after them and harness their energy. Restlessness Riflemen affects their mental health to end of life overtake them nervous diseases, which are rarely treatable.

Relatively often with Archers accidents happen, and the consequences of them, as a rule, affect the health in a long time. Fortunately, Sagittarius is endowed with optimism that helps them not to lose heart even in times of serious illness.

Usually do not Riflemen too good leather, and many of them suffer from dermatological diseases.

</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>

Sagittarius are not looking for easy ways to happiness, and it greatly affects his personal life. Fortunately, the representatives of this sign are endowed with a strong sense of self-preservation, so they avoid relationships that could harm them. And yet the failures in his personal life sometimes lie in wait for them. The reason for that is adventurous nature and inability to stay in the moment when it is needed. 

To prevent the archers in the attainment of personal happiness and spiritual harmony can and inherent stubbornness and a strong desire to teach everyone who has an opinion different from their own. For this reason many novels Sagittarius, starting exciting, often lead to the creation of unions in which practically true peace does not happen: there may be reasons for complaints and grievances, criticism, accusations and irritation. The Sagittarius does not seek to break up with her, and he does not dare to break, expecting that things will now go smoothly. Pair can exist long enough in the hope for harmony, but did not achieve it.

In order to become happier in your personal life, Sagittarians have to admit that, despite their inherent vigor, activity and spiritual power, sometimes feel the need to feel secure. Oddly enough, this lovers of adventures and dangerous adventures really appreciate in your partner stability, loyalty and devotion.

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. I can't choose the right partner<br>

Usually this complaining about Archers who already have some life experience and who left behind him a few not-so-good relationships. But sometimes this problem occurs and the young representatives of this sign, intuitively feel that their partner does not meet the needs of their souls.

In a romantic relationship Sagittarians tend to rely solely on his intuition, ignoring logic and common sense arguments. They are not scared of unequal marriages or unions that seem extravagant to others. The difference in age, ideology, religious views does not seem Sagittarius an insurmountable obstacle, when they are in love; the ability to be charmed and to believe in their own fantasies of the representatives of this sign is very high. However, sooner or later, you, like everyone else, have to go down to the earth; then it becomes clear that you are not able to find common ground or to make contact with his half on an intuitive, subconscious level. 

So, your life will become much easier if you are in a romantic relationship be guided not only emotions, but also common sense. Sometimes you need to listen to the advice and recommendations of people who you well know – or, at least, to take note of the opinion of others. Appeal people extravagant and unusual very large, but to deal with them is not easy – so keep that in mind when you feel about to lose her head.

<br>2. I love him (her), but I'm with him (her) boring<br>

Sagittarians are very freedom-loving and will not tolerate restrictions, change of sensations and new emotions necessary to them as air. If your partner is a person who aspires to stability, peace and predictability in the relationship, sometimes it can be quite serious difficulties. But the main problem is that early in a relationship you concentrate on your partner and don't want to see anything around; some time later, on the contrary, you cease to pay attention to the man who more than deserves.

Do not take romantic relationship as a system of constraints the realization or achievement of objectives. It would be wise to retain some "private" space and allow your partner to do the same – so each of you will remain opportunities for personal growth, and that is exactly what is important, not to lose interest to each other. 

If you love and appreciate your partner, don't let frivolous Hobbies to ruin your relationship. Coquetry and flirtation can you to cheer up – but, alas, not for long, and the consequences of such an error will dissipate soon.

<br>3. He requires too much of me<br>

Brave and strong Archers lose their inherent courage, when it comes to long term commitments. Members of this sign tend to maintain independence as long as possible and to have a way to retreat, even if they are sincerely attached to their partner. Difficulties arise in the moment when you need to translate light and nonchalant attitude in a more serious way; in this case, Sagittarians have a feeling that your partner expects too much from them.

If the partner is dear to you, try to objectively assess those claims, which he presents to you is quite it is possible that they are not overstated. However, it is necessary and reasonable attitude to their own desires and wishes; is it too much to want from a man you make to adapt to your independent and sometimes selfish and overly extravagant nature. Expecting that your partner will accept you for who you are, you lose sight of its own impermanence; in fact, the person whom you choose, has to constantly adapt to your mood. Importantly, what is expected of you is consistency and predictability in behavior; if you're in sufficiently open and learn to explain the reasons for their actions, to achieve harmony will be easier.

<br>4. Loving relationship change my character<br>

Freedom-loving, sometimes frivolous, cheerful Sagittarius in love is quite different. His character appear the severity and the tendency to jealousy, and common sense, the ability to act decisively and not be afraid, fade into the background. 

You are endowed with a strong will and can save it in any situation, without getting into an emotional dependence on their partner. Do not lose your independence, keep your own interests; it is sometimes necessary to preserve the "private property" even in the most trusting and intimate relationship, because it depends on your spiritual comfort. 

The real threat, as love relationships, personal development, may represent the loss of individuality. Remember that, as much as you were tied to her chosen, it is important to be yourself and not to blindly accept the line of conduct that may be offered tactfully and to impose. We must admit that Sagittarians rarely choose partners-tyrants, intuitively predicting the possible danger to themselves, but can become a victim of the manipulator, the master of psychological traps and intrigue. 

<br>5. He takes me seriously<br>

Sagittarians often impress people cheerful, optimistic, but completely frivolous and representatives of this sign their partners unjustly deprived of trust. It is hard to imagine that a perpetual and inexhaustible cheerfulness positive Musketeers hiding also the wisdom and deep intuitive understanding of life, and yet it is so.

Sagittarius rarely show their weaknesses, complain about failures or share concerns. That's why even those who constantly have to deal with them, believe that the representatives of this sign nothing seriously not worried. It is very important to learn to share your feelings with your partner, otherwise it is unlikely to be able to understand how deep can be your feelings and emotions, and take them seriously.

Many Sagittarians are so often the mask of unshakable joy and optimism that they themselves are getting used to it, refuse to support conversations on more or less serious topics to discuss long-term future. Watch his behavior. If in a difficult situation, your first reaction is to laugh it off, to show off a sense of humor and avoid a Frank conversation, we should not be surprised that your partner sees your relationship as a pleasant, but not too serious, and sees you as a person mood to deal with which is interesting in its own way, but sometimes equally tedious.

<br>6. A romantic relationship will never last for a long time<br>

Sagittarius is difficult for a long time to maintain a serious relationship a love of nature, as evidenced by the fact that the divorce rate among them is higher than other representatives of the sign. For many Riflemen marriage, even seemingly happy, is hard work, because of their independent nature resists any ties, and the desire for new experiences is hard to reconcile with faithfulness and constancy. In addition, Sagittarians usually have their own system of values, not fully coincide with the one that is accepted in society; sometimes it is difficult for them to find a partner who would be willing to live "not as all, and very quickly replaced the harmony comes the struggle for defending their own ideals.

To save a romantic relationship was not given to you by the sweat and blood, you must be very attentive to their true emotional needs. You hard to mislead, but sometimes being in love, you are substituting their own desires and aspirations of those that are peculiar to your chosen one. This is a direct path to inner disharmony, the consequence of which become or open conflict, or a cooling of relations, leading to rupture. Remember that to find a common language with the partner can only someone who is fluent in the language of their own, and do not settle for compromises before you understand that gain or lose personally by you.

It is also important that the Archers, most of them, apart from sensuality and emotionality, but also an extraordinary intellect. So the representatives of this sign will only win, if you do not blindly trust its enthusiastic love – a little prudence and composure will be useful to anyone who wants to avoid serious mistakes.

<br>7. We argue all the time<br>

The people are calm and not prone to public display of emotions hard to get along with Sagittarius: this sign are sometimes cutting and uncompromising, always ready to listen to the interlocutor, but part of the rush to the defense of their own interests even when and protect them from anyone. It may seem that Sagittarius is the initiator of the conflict in the pair, but it's not just "average temperature" of his feelings may be stronger than the partner.

So, if you are confident that provokes you elect not to quarrel on purpose, be prepared to work on yourself; if not same case, we can assume that there are a couple of very deep problem, the solution of which will require the efforts of both partners – unless, of course, they really want to save the relationship.

If quarrels arise over nothing, but the best way to prevent them is to understand the science of tact and diplomacy. At first it will seem that you are in need of huge concessions, but soon you will notice that the efforts are not in vain and relationships improve. No matter how trivial you hear the Council to listen to the person and try to accept his point of view, in your case it is very useful. The problem with many Sagittarius – the reluctance to part with the line of conduct "enemies are everywhere", a heightened desire for self-defense and overly emotional reaction to any criticism, even constructive. Be gentle; nature has given you an amazing intuition and ability to "feel" people, to understand their aspirations and desires – so don't let this gift to perish in oblivion. Too carried away with themselves, their feelings, you make partner in a toy of his passions – and yet, it is possible to see a personality, and personality is very attractive, because your choice was not accidental.

</p><strong>CAREER AND PROFESSION</strong><p>

Career Riflemen usually develops unevenly, and seemingly contrary to their nature: able to concentrate and to do the same thing for a long time, Sagittarius try not to be limited to one specialty, repeatedly starting my life from scratch. Hard work and focus to help them achieve success in almost any endeavor, but the closer to the top - the more Riflemen drawn to do something new or unknown.

For the most active and fearless Riflemen are best suited profession which scares people more peaceful and calm; the policemen, firemen, rescuers, military journalists, soldiers, pilots or divers - that's what the people of this sign, if one does not restrict their choice.

Many Sagittarians are prone to this, so be composers, performers or artists for the manufacture of tools.

Sagittarians by nature players and those who do not implement this tendency in business, usually become regulars at the casino or heavy hitters of the stock exchange. Sorry, but gambling Sagittarius usually have no luck, besides, easy money instantly funneling through their fingers.

From the inactivity of Sagittarians usually suffer, therefore, the work is an integral part of their lives, forcing us to sacrifice not only free time, but also the interests of the family.

</p><strong>SEXUALITY SIGN</strong><p>

First love usually catches up with Riflemen in childhood, and they are life-retain the ability to instantly carried away and all my heart be given to each new novel. Sagittarians are romantic and easy to enchant, but not particularly stable. It may seem that Sagittarius simply collects their love of victory, but it is not - it is really genuinely in love every time and seriously annoyed about the gap.

Sagittariuses should not blame the wind: they are just too active to be faithful. If Sagittarius will be able to find a partner that is able to change with it - or better yet, stay one step ahead, this novel can be as long as it is passionate.

However, it will have to seriously try: Sagittarians are inclined to get fresh erotic experiences by changing your partner or improve the relationship with those who have already fallen victim to their charm.

The number of sexual partners Sagittarians are generally high, and it is in the fact that people of this sign are always lucky in love. However, they are very afraid of the existence of possessiveness and often limit the relations with the liked man sex. For the same reason Sagittarians can for a long time maintain relationships with proprietary partner, as it does not threaten them by any fetters.

The fear of boredom inherent in Sagittarius, is also manifested in their sexual life. While Sagittarians rarely offer themselves to make the relationship a new element, but the ideas of the partner accept with enthusiasm. They generously share their knowledge and practice their skills in the company of a completely different person.

</p><strong>MARRIAGE AND COMPATIBILITY</strong><p>

The inclination to do important things without thinking, the most dramatic effect on family life of many Riflemen: they marry very early, not listening to anybody's advice; and, disappointed, hesitant to break the constraining their bonds. The fact is that people of this sign are very proud and would rather torture yourself and others and admit to the mistake. Sagittarians are inclined to praise your home, even in the case when actually fire it died long ago.

Neither men nor women born under the sign of Sagittarius, do not aspire to marriage. For happiness they need freedom, so their choices should not try to take over his "half" full. Partner with people of this sign usually appreciate the wit and erudition, not external attraction or passion.

Family life Sagittarius is very uneven: for periods of romantic passion followed by scandals caused by eccentricity and flare of anger inherent in this sign. At the same time to correct their mistakes Sagittarians usually do not know, but learn at least to make amends.

Sagittarians are not averse to commanding favorite, but such relationships do not suffer. Direct criticism hurting them is not a joke, but if Sagittarius is in a bad mood, he's able to do the problem and bring it to rupture.

Married Sagittarians can seem unpredictable and can flare up because every little thing, but the point here is rather that they are accustomed to hide their feelings and weaknesses, even from a loved one, and give vent to feelings only when to correct mistakes too late.

The Sagittarius will be the Union of two successful and interesting, full of adventures and travels. An excellent pair will make Sagittarius Aries, realizing his rebellious soul, but cleverly softening selfishness and aggressiveness.

Sagittarius will find the key to the vain heart of a Lion, besides charging the partner of your energy and lust for life.

But the Union with the Fishes is unlikely to emerge. The fact that the vehemence characteristic of Sagittarius, is able to scare vulnerable and sensitive Fish.


</p><strong>CULINARY PREFERENCES</strong><p>

Sagittarius is necessary to observe moderation in eating, but to ensure that the power was varied. Otherwise they are overly fond of oily and spicy food, but forget about fresh vegetables and fruits, and juices, or tea unwittingly take alcohol, which generally cost would be deleted.

Sagittarians have to be very careful in the consumption of seafood; Japanese food can cause their rejection. Fish preferred in boiled or baked form, without seasonings with a sharp taste and fatty sauces.

Useful in the diet of beans, cauliflower, carrots,tomatoes.

</p><strong>CHILDREN'S HOROSCOPE</strong><p>

Young Sagittarians are among those charming and cute children everywhere surrounded by attention, is easy to get new friends and have a lot of sponsors among adults. With them really easy to get along: Sagittarius from an early age peculiar to the particular openness to the world, which distinguishes them throughout life. But if Archers say that they think surrounding I remember that "from the mouths of Babes the truth"; when the same is done for Sagittarians are adults, their reproach tactlessness and lack of sensitivity.

Sagittarians have the same high requirements both to himself and to adults. Such a child will not patiently listen to the accusations of laziness and negligence, from a person who himself cannot boast of diligence and accuracy. While his words children Sagittarians do not climb; once they start talking with their mouth flies very sharp observations.

To gain and retain the respect of the child-Sagittarius difficult. This will require not only a brilliant mind and outstanding ability, but also self-criticism, the ability to admit their mistakes and apologize for them, as well as a sense of justice.

Sagittarians are so curious, sometimes this does not help but hinders their school success. Endless issues with this student many teachers baffled and pull the child-Sagittarius to a variety of experiments can be dangerous for him and his classmates. But the main problem is that Sagittarius loves to get new information, but makes no effort to keep her in the head. At best, he will remember where to find information or who to ask a related question.

Negatively Sagittarians are any restrictions on its freedom. Parents are unlikely to be able to keep such a child at home if he wants to walk, to dictate to him what books to read, what clothes to wear. But do not think that Sagittarius skips heed your advice and comments: he carefully analyzes them to draw their own conclusions.

Sagittarians are very amorous – this can be seen already at an early age. In almost any company, in which a child-Sagittarius, he very quickly there is a "special" friend. Any disappointment of a romantic nature, these children are experiencing is very easy; to deprive them of their optimism and confidence for anyone.</p><hr><br>According to the materials mail.ru
