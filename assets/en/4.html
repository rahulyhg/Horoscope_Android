</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>

Cancers often have a fine mental organization, which makes them particularly interesting to others. The mood of the representatives of this sign is rarely stable because they are very sensitive and vulnerable. Cancers are often subjected to despair, lose optimism and faith in yourself. At such moments, nothing can please, and the attempts of some way to cheer yourself are unsuccessful.

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. He doesn't appreciate my efforts<br>

Cancers are endowed with the strongest desire to care for others. Surrounding sometimes they seem completely helpless and therefore in need of constant care. Neither reward nor gratitude for their efforts, the representatives of this sign do not wait, but sometimes that happens seems unfair to them; furthermore, it is extremely frustrating sometimes to see that efforts are in vain and people clearly ignore the wonderful opportunities open to them thanks to Cancers.

Responsible for happiness, health and prosperity of the family, of course, it's hard, but think about how alone you doing? Most likely, your partner is not an absolute bum, just his diligence and care are of a different nature and a different shape than yours. 

Besides, you should understand that people are not always grateful for the help offered, and your thoughtfulness sometimes borders on manifestation proprietary instinct or even dictated by them. Try to relax, give your partner the opportunity to do as he sees fit, even if not always his decisions seem optimal. On the other hand, if you feel that the responsibility for the development romantic relationships entirely rests on your shoulders, you should pay attention to partner on this – it's possible that he does not suspect that the cargo is too heavy for you.

<br>2. I love him (her), but don't feel happy(s) with her<br>

Even in good times Cancers often experience a strong feeling of discomfort, suffer from mood swings, lack of self-confidence. In a romantic relationship, it often causes problems; Cancers are easily offended or upset, but comfort is much more difficult. Habit to withdraw into themselves, to survive long because of the wrongs inflicted, sometimes imaginary, common to many Cancers and sometimes seriously complicates their lives.

In order to cope with this problem, you have to seriously work on themselves. Much of the complexity arises from the fact that you are amenable gloomy mood, not trying to fight it and not allowing others to dispel. Should change your attitude to the situation; remember that depression is not a natural part of your life, and it can be eliminated if you apply some effort. It is also important to learn the offense and to leave behind the weight of old difficulties, otherwise the memory that once you have to suffer, will stop to enjoy the company of a loved one. 

The higher you'll appreciate the pleasant emotions that are due to his elect, and the more good will notice the relationship, the less you will have opportunities for experiences, debilitating mental strength.

<br>3. He doesn't understand me<br>

Cancers often produce a false impression even on those who knows them well. It is difficult to guess what honey, sociable and perfectly balanced Cancer may experience a lack of confidence, panic fear of failure or ridicule. To win the trust of Cancer is difficult to retain it is even more difficult; the cause of the problems in a romantic relationship often becomes the fact that you are afraid to open up in front of his elect to the end.

Another problem can be that to understand some of the features of your character to other characters can be very difficult. So, many interpret your concern as a manifestation of the proprietary instinct and try to protect themselves from the care that you offer sincerely.

So before accusing your partner of being unable to understand you, evaluate your own behavior – it's possible that it needs to be adjusted and that will be enough in order to pair harmony reigned.

<br>4. I don't know how to start (to finish) the relationship<br>

Oddly enough, the reason these two issues, seemingly contradictory, the one you are afraid to take the initiative. Cancers is difficult to make the first move and approach the person who they care about, but more problems arise in the moment when you need to break the relationship, even if they only bring pain and suffering.

Remember that nature has given you a strong enough character, and not to use this, at least, stupid. High confidence and a little willingness to fight are the main components of your success in your personal life. 

Your desire to not be miserable and understandable true, so take action to make it come true – go for it!

<br>5. I can't find a suitable partner<br>

Cancers, especially the very young, really not so easy to do. There are several reasons. The first one is excessive exposure to the influence of parents and family members. Cancers often bring in their own romantic relationship stereotypes and mistakes of their relatives are looking for in a partner, mother or father, trying to compensate for children's resentment. Try to grow up emotionally before you start to build a romantic relationship – it will greatly facilitate your life.

Another salient point to be cancer – the desire to find a partner who will need care and support, permanent attention and control. It is this instinct and leads many of you to choose a people for whom often have to sacrifice themselves, to sacrifice their interests. A little selfishness will not hurt you. Defeating "the instinct of a lifeguard, you will relieve yourself from relationships that can be fatal.

<br>6. Cabinfever<br>

The inability to find their "soul mate" is the problem of many Cancers. Representatives of this sign are often difficult to take the first step towards convergence. In addition, in his youth Cancers are much smaller than all the others, inclined to attend events where you can make new acquaintances.

The easiest way to cope with loneliness is to communicate more with people, having overcome his shyness and brought up faith in yourself. Others may take your usual shyness for coldness or even arrogance. Don't let that belief get stronger. You can be very attractive when a little lift the sink, which is usually hidden. Open it for a while – maybe this will be enough to find someone from whom you never have to hide my feelings.

<br>7. I'm not sure of the seriousness of our relationship<br>

Alas, doubt it is characteristic of all Cancers, and there is little that depends on what the situation actually is. The danger of the situation lies in the fact that in order to obtain the confirmation of the "gravity", you risk to put too much pressure on your partner that will not contribute to the improvement of your relationship.

What you really need is reflection and analysis. If you're not cool, you run the risk of becoming a victim of your doubts and negative thoughts, and then even the most serious relationship can be destroyed by your fault.

Trying to soberly and objectively evaluate the actions of the partner, you will be able to understand whether he shows towards you attention and care – and appreciate what you do for him.

</p><strong>CAREER AND PROFESSION</strong><p>

Cancers attract the attention of the opposite sex from an early age – they are not just romantic and dreamy, but are prone to novels. To get involved for the first time met a Cancer man, perhaps, will not be able to, but he felt the attention to itself, melts like chocolate in the sun.

In sexual life Cancers are usually rather excellent students than creative mentors. They do not have a strong temperament, but I try not to disappoint the partner. Crawfish lovers are painfully insecure that produces a false impression of coldness.

Good service in matters of the heart Cancer can render its inherent sense of humor is awkward over the situation Cancer can laugh. But when it comes to serious frustration, he really suffers and is capable of reckless acts that you later regret.

Cancer is cautious in love relationships, he does not forget about the need to protect yourself and your partner, so romantic interests if and harm to his health, it is only mental.

</p><strong>MARRIAGE AND COMPATIBILITY</strong><p>

Well and to the mutual satisfaction of the relationship of Cancer and Taurus, since the representatives of these signs usually have a similar value system. But with Virgo Cancer does not get as unlikely to appreciate the high aspirations of their partner.

The Union of the two Cancers are unlikely to give pleasure to some of them; most likely, they will exist side by side, but will lead novels on the side. Libra is able to brighten the lives of Cancer.
