"RAM" (Aries) has the honor to open zodiac horoscope point of the spring equinox: when the signs of the Zodiac got their modern name, she was in this constellation. Meanwhile, people born under this sign have sufficient strength and determination to forge ahead even in cases where the circumstances, it would seem, does not add up in their favor.

Energy and indefatigability Rams were legendary as was their stubbornness and complete lack of flexibility in the nature. The rams can't give in even for tactical reasons, much to harm themselves, especially at a young age, when still do not have experience, able to subdue the natural vehemence.

Natural optimism does not allow the rams to give up even in the most adverse situations, but criticism, especially from loved ones to knock them out of the rut: being vain, people need constant encouragement and recognition of their achievements.

Strong character Rams-women mitigated natural softness peculiar to their gender, but should encounter an obstacle in their way — and the sign of the Zodiac takes its toll. Temper ladies born under this sign, is complicated and a lot more what do Aries men, strong idealism, the inability to realistically assess people and embrace life in all its fullness.

Aries male is capable of hitting a power and business acumen, but deep down, gray hair remain children. They waste their remarkable power on problems, not worth a damn, but can't concentrate for the things that really matter; turn a deaf ear to good advice, but badly in need of sympathy, if suddenly will fail.

</p><strong>PSYCHOLOGICAL PORTRAIT</strong><p>

Aries refers to the active signs, which are also referred to as male. Traits peculiar to people of this sign, do not allow him to remain aloof from the events of life, or to withdraw into a world of his own family: the Rams are not just open to the world, they absolutely believe that we can change this world for the sake of what will spare no effort or resources.

People born under this sign throughout the life of the emotions, which are not even trying to hide. Their feelings and actions Aries fickle, they even unpleasant residue does not remain in the soul after the fit of rage or anger; good the mood, as bad, disappears without a trace.

Aries - extroverts, but the problems surrounding them worry a little: the world of the people of this sign are perceived more as a background against which they stand out and look especially brilliant. Not surprisingly, therefore, solely engaged themselves, the Rams did not understand the people, can easily become the victims of skillful manipulators.

Despite the tenacity and unwavering confidence, Aries is able to take into account the arguments of logic, though they are guided by intuition rather that they have extremely well developed.

</p><strong>THE ELEMENT OF THE SIGN</strong><p>

The element of Aries Is Fire - rewards the people of this sign of power, speed and unstoppable.

In the Trigon of Fire (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) Aries are allocated a certain aggressiveness in everything, be it business or emotional interests, the ability to instantly change the direction of its activities, as well as to quickly restore power after the defeat.

For the weakest of Aries Fire fatal – unable to cope with their own energy, they burn themselves, but the rest of the element gives the ability to possess the minds of others, the desire for power and thirst for adventure.

Strangely enough, it was the Rams very often get burned, and sometimes very serious. It illustrates the inability of many of them to properly use what is given to them by nature.

</p><strong>HEALTH</strong><p>

The rams, who are accustomed to the strength and endurance of your body, often themselves guilty of their own health problems. They have too much work, too little sleep, ignoring the principles of good nutrition and regular exercise of their lack of patience.

Almost all Aries sooner or later get a head injury. In addition, people of this sign are prone to migraines and diseases of the eye, to go to the doctors Aries tend to avoid, preferring lightly to self-medicate, often on the principle of "self-will".

Because of addiction Rams to tasty, but not healthy food, their skin,  especially on the face, often covered by a rash.

Aries lucky if there'll be a person who is able to tactfully and gently remind you to relax, walk regularly and eat right - in short, to take care of themselves.

</p><strong>THE KEYS TO SUCCESS IN LOVE</strong><p>

The sign of Aries gives his players the strongest power and the desire to be first in everything. This sometimes leads the pioneers of the Zodiac – they spend too much time in a variety of competitions, instead of to succeed in the field that is most important. Sometimes comparing yourself with others, Aries feels discomfort due to the fact that his achievement is not as impressive, and demands not what he needs, and what other have. So, a precondition of success – that is, achieving a feeling of satisfaction with your own life – is the correct formulation objective and rational use of its forces.

Aries is often difficult life inability to concentrate long to keep the interest to make one. Patience and persistence the representatives of this sign are not different, that is why it is quite difficult to maintain a long romantic relationship. Many believe the Rams are so incapable of fidelity, which in principle does not consider the relationship with them as something serious – and it is also not conducive to personal happiness representatives of this sign.

Seven typical problems – the seven keys to happiness in love

<br>1. "Cabinfever"<br>

In the case of the Rams, it usually means that in the field of view there is no man who would have seemed not only appealing, but is not available. Nothing fascinates Rams as the ability to overcome obstacles, to charm, to conquer, to melt the ice cold heart. Those who are initially friendly and is open to representatives of this sign, cause they have little interest.

In order to become more happy, Aries needs to understand that a loving relationship is not hunting, but their choice – not the prey. Look around: there are probably people society which you enjoy. Aries rarely can to complain about the lack of fans, rather they worry about what is not there "the man himself" that would arouse the strongest feelings, to arouse interest. However, you need to keep in mind that your emotions depend primarily is from you and not from someone else. Try to become interested in those who are near, and not wait fateful encounter that will radically change your life.

It should also be noted that for Aries is very dangerous may be a loss of faith in himself after the break with a loved one or divorce. Being in such a situation, you tend to start the search for a new partner which may even will not have a little bit of serious feelings. There are several variants of the situation development. Some Aries punish the new darling for the sins of his predecessor, others find someone who sympathize with their troubles, and fall into the trap of becoming addicted to it, others fear that "competition" is too high, entering a totally inappropriate relationship. The obvious solution is to not rush to start a new novel. You need to regain faith in yourself; meet, talk and try to spend more time and concentrate on what you really like. It will make you not only compelling, but also happy.

<br>2. "He (she) doesn't understand me"<br>

The lack of understanding with a partner – is a typical problem for the representatives of many signs of the Zodiac. Aries are often confronted with her because produce a false impression, and sometimes they are unable to make sense of what they need. Partner you are a man of vigorous and sometimes aggressive; able to take care of themselves and to support the weak, to overcome any obstacles. Of course, all this is so. But we must not forget that and you have moments when you want to get help, to hear words of encouragement, to feel cared for.

Not hide your weaknesses, don't hesitate to ask for what you want to get. The initial phase will have to keep it under control, to control the tone and form of requests, which in any case should not resemble the orders. In General, is to learn when it is necessary to remove from the voice aggressive and metallic notes. Look for Scales – how they behave with partners, has much to teach you.

Another thing that you need to be sure to learn every self – respecting Aries is to explain your actions. Remember that "I want" or "you" are arguments convincing, but not enough. Your partner deserves to know why you act this way and not otherwise. You chose the person who you can trust, right?

<br>3. "My partner is only interested in sex, and I want a serious relationship"<br>

It is possible that your partner feels the same. Aries appreciate physical intimacy and do not hide it, but the fact that also need emotional intimacy, prefer to hide.

The problem is rather that under a "serious relationship" Aries mean something very special – a joint conquest of the dangerous vertices, overcoming the storms of life, the struggle for happiness. Alas, the ideals of your choice can be quite different. Partner, dreaming first of all about the peace and confidence in marriage or a love Union, many of your actions will be perceived as extravagant antics, adventures, jokes of bad taste – in a word, things, saying "serious relationship" is rather inappropriate. So the conflict of interest is obvious. In this case, without counselling and work on yourself not do, so be prepared.

<br>4. "I love him (her), but I'm with him / her boring"<br>

Boredom Aries can not stand. Sometimes it's state of mind is the only thing that really scared the representatives of this sign. At the initial stage of a romantic relationship boredom is usually no place – even if obstacles in the path of love does not arise, Aries quite regularly organize yourself and your partner a shake (sometimes in the form of quarrels and even partings "forever"), only in order to achieve the exacerbation of feelings. However, with the development of relations, the situation changes. In some cases, the partner gets used to the antics of the RAM and will not respond to them as expected, in others it is clearly makes it clear that is not going to tolerate them further. Ulavlivaya peace and quiet, but Aries is feeling depressed and bored.

It would seem that the output is quite obvious – it is possible to find common interests and Hobbies that will add variety to life. The problem is that the RAM more energy than that of the other characters, and the pursuit of diversity is also significantly stronger. You will not get bored, if dividing the interests of the partner, save the right of every individual to some independence and autonomy, but it is not important. It's really important to understand that a stable relationship is no less interesting and exciting than the conquest of an appealing man, a series of reconciliations and quarrels, stormy showdown. As soon as you realize it, the boredom will cease to be the third in a love Union.

<br>5. "We can never agree"<br>

Many Aries does not know how to conduct a constructive conversation with those whom you love; under the influence of this sign of any "problem" conversation turns into an argument – and there to scandal near. To ensure that you have the opportunity to negotiate with the chosen one, you have to "learn to negotiate".

My advice is simple, but following them is extremely difficult. Try to use for training conversation on General topics, not directly related neither you nor your partner. So, take the time to listen to the interlocutor and to agree with him – at least partly. Get your idea that refuting heard, you prove the intellectual superiority; in other words, don't argue just to be right. Do not rush the opponent – you make decisions quickly, but not all do that, so no need to escalate the situation. And keep in mind that discussing problems is not who was right, and in order to come to a common opinion. Learning to give and not to worry about this, you will make your life much easier and more enjoyable.

<br>6. "I'm not sure in our relationship"<br>

Make sure your partner is not sure about them even more! Because you at least sometimes know what to expect from myself, and the other is practically inaccessible.

Quite often the Rams, especially at a young age, not seeking marriage or a serious relationship, and it affects their behavior. You get older, but acquired habits (e.g., willingness to ignore conventional rules, prone to all sorts of provocations), alas, remain. And you can hint to your partner that you are "doing well" and "walk up", and even to speak openly about this – he's not believe until you get rid of those habits.

In addition, the person who knows you well, can't help noticing your desire to power, the rule in the relationship. That's why he appreciates the moments of their independence, the situation where you can make a guess, finally, just take a break from you. You at this time and are unsure. If you want to change the situation, will have to work on ourselves – to learn gentleness, to master the subtleties of diplomacy, to know the charm of compromise.
And last. Sometimes the root of "uncertainty" that you just don't can prove to others that your novel is the most durable, best in all respects. No need to try to do that. In the end, personal relationships are not accidentally called that way.

<br>7. "He is constantly making a dig at me"<br>

The rams are accustomed to the fact that their praise – indeed, there is something. All that more or less resembles criticism, the representatives of this sign are perceived as nitpicking and the signal to start fighting. In short, you are overreacting.
Try to look at the situation from the other side. Hardly a person that you know will provoke situations that could trigger your anger – if he is alive, of course. The fight with Aries in most cases is hopeless, and no one will get it at will. But then why favorite people again and again speaks of your disadvantages? First, it is possible that he just gives advice or, say, indicates the direction in which you should send your tireless energy. Do not take the information in the vein of "you're doing bad", its main message is "how to make it better."

You also need to recognize that sometimes your vote there is a reason for criticism. This is especially true when the "conquest" period is completed and in relationships is becoming calm, but in other cases not excluded. The fact that Aries is active and energetic at an early stage of development of relations, as well as in difficult, crisis situations. When the storm subsides, you become like a child – sometimes capricious and spoiled, constantly demanding attention, sometimes completely unable to take care of yourself. Your chosen one is much nicer to see you another: bright, energetic, shining intelligence and wit, inventive, and endowed with a rich imagination; it is to this state he hopes that you return your comments that you are perceived as lacking grounds for nitpicking.

</p><strong>CAREER AND PROFESSION</strong><p>

Aries are strong enough to succeed in many areas, but their inherent sincerity is more appropriate in the army than in politics. People born under this sign, are simply not enough flexibility and tricks needed in order to realize his talents in diplomacy, not having made mortal enemies.

Being a creative, Aries is able to make artistic career in the broadest sense of the word; luck can wait for them both on the stage and in the Studio of the sculptor. In his youth the most ambitious members of this sign are blinded by the desire for power and glory, working against them: Aries prefer to dream of a glorious future, and not to strive to achieve goals, though modest, but real.

With Rams-managers have subordinates hard enough: they are freedom-loving, ignoring labor discipline, interested in easy work, but just as quickly and forget about it. On the other hand, in a difficult situation, the Rams are showing their best side: they are extremely hardworking, resourceful, in short, become the perfect "crisis managers".

</p><strong>SEXUALITY SIGN</strong><p>

Starting your sex life is usually relatively early, the Rams, however, until a very Mature age remain in erotic terms rather bold experimenters than the experienced experts. Passion of Aries is always fresh, so the people of this sign of each partner in love as the first - and certainly want him to be the only one. We will add that natural activity and endurance Rams makes them tireless.

In sex, as in any other area of life, Aries require constant approval, the highest possible assessment of their abilities. Words of admiration and praise can inspire Aries new sexual exploits.

Aries woman is extremely bold in sexual experimentation, the man is more cautious for him there can be nothing worse than to experience a fiasco; but he is not afraid to get in a funny position, so it is able to offer his lady to indulge in passion in the most unexpected place.

Aries can scare your partner is demanding, and then surprise with tenderness and attention, striking combined with his passion, sometimes bordering on aggressive.

</p><strong>MARRIAGE AND COMPATIBILITY</strong><p>

Aries are able to experience strong passions - alas, sometimes too strong to be happy. Easy falling in love, they idealize the partner, and, faced with the first serious lack of it, I feel disappointed and cheated.

Women know how to charm their independence, but their freedom sometimes comes to the point of absurdity. This ladies-Aries are extremely jealous; what they consider acceptable for themselves, often do not forgive the partner. Amorous women Aries side could seem promiscuity, if most of the novels did not remain just dreams.

Aries Men addicted quickly and love very much; their novels are beautiful, but short - term-partly because of the selfishness inherent in the people of this sign. Partner of Aries will have to work hard to interest in it never waned, but it has a chance to earn real adoration.

The Union Rams with people of their same sign is bright, but fragile. Two enthusiastic person, each of which is too selfish to care for the partner, get tired too quickly from each other.

Most can be called a harmonious Union with the Lion. Not bad get along with Aries and Sagittarius, whose innate nobility beneficial to himaffected.

A good Union with the Twins; neutral: Cancer or Capricorn: in both cases, it is more about intellectual harmony than about spiritual unity.

Union with Weights will be unsuccessful, and the gap is painful for both. Do not get on with Aries with Pisces, Scorpio and Taurus.

</p><strong>CULINARY PREFERENCES</strong><p>

Aries prefer food cooked on an open fire, while avoiding needlessly fresh vegetables and fruits. The rams needed vitamin-rich diet.

With diets people of this sign should be careful: calories they need to recuperate.

You should not forget about the inclusion in the diet unloved Rams fish and other seafood.

</p><strong>CHILDREN'S HOROSCOPE</strong><p>

Children-Aries – known restless, tireless innovators and inventors, and along with a permanent headache for the parents. With these kids it happens all the most incredible thing: they are involved in an incredible story, trying to get away from home or to start a revolution in school scale.

To raise a child-the RAM is not easy, but interesting. It is important not to show too much rigor, but also with the flexibility to not overdo it, otherwise the RAM will not understand what responsibility, self-discipline and self-discipline.

Traditionally, children-Aries are not able to cheat. Actually it's not quite so. Just young representatives of this sign are endowed with special insight that helps them to recognize the deception. At first, they believe that others can, and therefore always prefer to tell the truth. Over time, the ability to expose weakens, but the ability (and the desire) to lie did not appear. But Aries is incredible dreamers fictions which have no end. They are able to imagine how it looks "what in the wide world there could be", and talk about it in detail so that adults have no choice but to believe.

The ability of the Rams are very diverse: young representatives of this sign is equally easy given the exact, natural and human Sciences, there they have problems with drawing and music. School their success mostly depend on teachers: if to arouse the RAM, the interest in some area of knowledge, he will be able to beat not only other students but also the teacher. 
Typical Aries mobility, curiosity and carelessness create that explosive combination that makes the representatives of this sign are frequent visitors to the emergency room and doctor's offices. To keep the RAM from adventure and exploration impossible, but to accustom to caution is necessary.

Wrong the common belief that the Rams will always be kids. More correct to say that they permanently retain many of the features of adolescence – the idealism, the temper, uncompromising, keen sense of justice, as well as the sensitivity and vulnerability hiding under a mask of cynicism.</p><hr><br>According to the materials mail.ru
